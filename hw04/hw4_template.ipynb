For example, this assignment requires you to create plots. You could do it directly with python using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), but if you wanted to create them using other software, that's acceptable as long as you put all of the figures in a single document and you clearly label them with the corresponding deliverable number.\n",

    "- **Collaboration:** You are allowed to work with a partner. You are still expected to write up your own solution. Each individual must turn in their own submission, and list your collaborator after your name.\n",
    "- **Late submissions:** We allow each student to use up to 5 late days over the semester. You have late days, not late hours. This means that if your submission is late by any amount of time past the deadline, then this will use up a late day. If it is late by any amount beyond 24 hours past the deadline, then this will use a second late, and so on. Once you have used up all late days, late assignments will be given at most 80% credit after one day and 60% credit after two days."

    "### Tokenization and feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to convert the raw text into feature vectors. In Ch. 8 of the book, and in HW2, the class [`CountVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) is presented as a way to convert text strings into `sklearn` feature vectors. This class can automatically perform tokenization (doing preprocessing steps we talked about in class, including lowercasing and stripping punctuation). However, for this assignment, we aren't going to use `CountVectorizer`, though it is useful to know about. We will instead write our own code to do tokenization and feature extraction. This will allow us to modify the features, which you will need to do later, plus it will let you see how feature extraction is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below defines our feature extraction function, `features`. It takes a text string and it outputs a Python dictionary where the keys are the feature names and the values are the feature values. This is a _sparse_ representation, meaning it only outputs features with nonzero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the features extracted by this function are n-gram counts. The keyword argument `ngram_range` specifies the length of n-grams to extract. This argument should be a pair of integers, where the first integer is the lower end of the length to be extracted and the second integer is the upper end. For example, `ngram_range=(1,3)` will extract 1-grams, 2-grams, and 3-grams, while `ngram_range=(2,2)` will extract only 2-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function performs two initial preprocessing steps: making the text lowercase (so different capitalizations of words will map to the same feature), and removing consecutive characters that are repeated more than twice (e.g., \"woooow\" and \"wooooooooow\" will both map to simply \"woow\" rather than being counted as separate words).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function tokenizes words as follows. First, non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with whitespace, then strings separated by whitespace are treated as tokens. Python's `split` function converts a string into a list of tokens that were separated by whitespace. The list of tokens is passed to the `ngrams` function, defined below, which returns a list of all n-grams of length `n` contained in the list. Finally, the function also pulls out tokens containing anything _but_ alphanumeric characters. This will capture punctuation marks and emojis, which may also be useful for classification. These are treated as unigram features rather than longer sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, simply run the code below. However, you'll need to modify this code later, so you need to understand what it is doing."

    "### Creating new features\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now expand the feature set by implementing a new type of feature. You get to choose which type of feature to implement, from a set of three possibilities described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4604 students:** You must implement one of the three types of features for full credit. You will earn 4 extra credit points for each additional type of feature that you correctly implement (up to 8 EC points possible).\n",
    "- **5604 students:** You must implement two of the three types of features for full credit. You will earn 4 extra credit points for additionally implementing the third feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you add new features? You will need to create a new feature extraction function. Start by copying the definition of the `features` function at the start of this notebook and renaming it. Keep everything from the original function, but write additional code that appends your new features to the `features_in_text` array. You can create any additional helper functions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of each feature type is below. Be sure to read the instructions carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skip-grams:** A type of feature that is related to an n-gram is a _skip-gram_. Skip-grams can be defined in different ways, but the definition you will use here is a sequence of word tokens where only the first and last word are specified, while any word token in between is replaced with a general placeholder symbol (usually an asterisk, $*$). For example, the string \"the water is cold\" contains two length-3 skip-grams (\"`the * is`\" and \"`water * cold`\") and one length-4 skip-gram (\"`the * * cold`\"). The purpose of skip-grams is to capture longer sequences while being general enough to match more instances than with longer n-grams. To implement a skip-gram of length $k$, you can simply extract $k$-grams (i.e., n-grams of length $k$) and replace the inner tokens with asterisks. Like with the n-gram features, the values of the skip-gram features should be their counts. For this assignment, you should extract skip-grams of both length 3 and length 4.\n",
    "- **Word pairs:** It may be helpful to encode combinations of words that appear in a document, regardless of whether they appear in a particular sequence. One type of feature is to indicate if two words are both present in a text (like doing an *AND* operation on the presense of the two unigrams). For example, the string \"the water is cold\" contains 6 distinct word pairs (\"`(the,water)`\", \"`(the,is)`\", \"`(the,cold)`\", \"`(water,is)`\", \"`(water,cold)`\", \"`(is,cold)`\"). For full credit, your code should not include pairs that are permutations of each other $-$ for example, include `(water,cold)` or `(cold,water)` but not both. An easy way to do this is to sort the words in alphabetical order within pairs. For this feature, simply use the value $1$ if the pair is present in a text and $0$ otherwise (that is, binary values rather than using full counts).\n",
    "- **Sentiment dictionary:** One might also take advantage of external resources others have created for sentiment analysis. For this type of feature, we will use a sentiment *lexicon* created by researcher [Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), which is a list of words that have a tendency to show positive sentiment and a list of words with negative sentiment. The lexicon contains thousands of words; the words are already loaded for you in the code cell below. For this feature, you should extract n-grams (using whatever n-gram range was randomly selected above) where any word that appears in the positive dictionary is replaced with the capitalized string \"`POS`\" and any word in the negative dictionary is replaced with the string \"`NEG`\". For example, the word \"cold\" is in the negative dictionary, so the string \"the water is cold\" should have five unigrams all with value $1$ (\"`the`\", \"`water`\", \"`is`\", \"`cold`\", \"`NEG`\"), and four bigrams with value with $1$ (\"`the water`\", \"`water is`\", \"`is cold`\", \"`is NEG`\").\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing your new function, you should test the function on a few example strings to see if it is extracting features in the way you expect."
