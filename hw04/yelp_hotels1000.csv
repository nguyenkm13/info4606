6772,train,1,"I absolutely love this hotel. I stayed here for a few nights and I absolutely loved every second of it. Honestly, I think I will be staying here every time I go to Vegas from here on out. That's how much I enjoyed the Cosmo. The rooms are amazing and spacious, they almost all have amazing views and its a really big grandiose hotel.  I'm glad that they've toned down the glittery aspects of the hotel from what it used to be when  it opened, which was gaudy and painful to the eyes. Now its just classy and full of amazing bars, restaurants and people. I really enjoy walking through this hotel and just getting drinks with friends at the Chandelier (a gigantic 3 storey bar under a chandelier).  The parking situation could be better, but I do appreciate the parking sensors that tell you which spots are occupied and which spots are open. I also don't like that you have to take an elevator from the parking garage to the main lobby level and then take the elevators from the lobby level to the rooms. ALSO they really need to fix the card readers in the elevators because they don't work. Please adopt NFC for your keycards or something because the card readers in the elevators are embarassingly broken."

5252,test,1,Stayed at the wrapped around suite in 61 floor.  The room and the view is perfect!  Make sure to ask for a higher floor room.  The price is the same but thr view is not.  I deducted one star for the hot water being way too hot.  I mean really really hot.  I couldnt take a proper shower.
1272,train,1,"This hotel is new, built in 2010-11, the airport is very close but don't worry you won't be disturbed by the noise.  The rooms are large, very clean, the staff is very friendly. There is a pool, business center, gym center, restaurant, free parking, well everything you need to have a perfect stay.  Very nice stay at this Holiday Inn, will repeat!"
6984,train,1,"The only spot on the strip that does not make me want to barf and go home.  Fantastic, edgy, steampunk art.  Sleek and lovely, douchebag factor seems pretty low.  Intelligent restaurants and shopping designed for the more discriminating strip-go'er."
6982,train,-1,"I am a gold member of Marriott [recently a Platinum member as well] and have stayed at Cosmopolitan before on multiple occasions. Yes, we all know it's a beautiful hotel, I cannot deny that. I was originally going to give them 1 star for the terrible customer service we were given this past weekend, I am truly disappointed in how they treat their Gold Members here; however I will mention that they have made efforts in trying to fix the problem, hence now the 2 stars. If you're going to treat me just like a normal guest, what is the incentive for me to keep staying here? I waited the whole weekend not to write this review and thought that I would feel better after the weekend, but no, I am still pissed off at their customer service.   Let me start out by saying a group of 9 girls are here for a Bachelorette party. We booked Qty 2, double queen Terrace Suite rooms. We arrived at 9:30am in the morning, knowing check in is at 3pm, but hoping the rooms would be available in the morning anyway so that we can prep 1 of the rooms for the Bride-to-be's arrival. No rooms were available. They even had the reservations incorrect, as the system said that I had only booked 1-king bed room, and another double queen bed room. [We had booked this many months prior to our arrival] When I showed them my confirmation email, they had acknowledged that they had it wrong in the system and will change it to reflect the correct rooms. They also told me check-out is at 11am so most likely there wasn't going to be any rooms available until at least check-out when they could clean some rooms for us. I had mentioned that we would prefer to have adjoining rooms however understood that it can't be guaranteed, but we at least wanted the rooms to be on the same floor for convenience. Ok...so we left to do other things but continued to keep checking in throughout the day. Nothing was available, not even at 3pm, which is the regular check-in time. NOT EVEN 1 ROOM. Really? You're telling me, that check out was at 11am. And that not even 1 room had checked out, and was cleaned by 3pm?? We had been waiting around at the Vesper bar where the waitress had walked past us probably at least 20 times and noticed we had been there practically the whole day. When she asked the situation, she must've felt bad for us, and told us that when we finally do check into our room, to let her know what the room number it is, so that she can send up some champagne for the inconvenience and for it also being a Bachelorette party.  [Fast Forward: When we finally were able to check into the room, we did give her the room number...and guess what....no champagne ever came - great intention but don't promise something you can't keep!] By 330pm I had had enough, and complained about how we have been waiting around [for what felt like forever] and please just to find us 1 room so we can get checked in and relaxed. They said they were able to get us 1 room (it wasn't going to be adjoining rooms - but by that time, that was fine) So excited to get into our 1 room while we continued to wait for our 2nd room to be available. We get in....and it's a 1-King Size bed room, for 9 girls. Lovely, just lovely. We finally called on the phone and asked to speak with a manager to get us into a double queen room, in which she [I think Emily] kept saying that there was no other rooms available at the moment and that she WASNT EVEN SURE if there will be one available for us TODAY at all. They even tried to tell us that we could use the Sleeper Pull Out Sofa in the meantime.... OK 1 king size bed and 1 sleeper pull-out [which was uncomfortable as hell] FOR 9 GIRLS?! Really? I can't even believe this was suggested. Finally, after being put on hold multiple times and them trying to find the 2nd room for us, they came with this solution: We would stay in that current 1 king size bed room, and they got another double queen room for us (for that night) and the next day, they would look for 2 double queen bed rooms for us but it wasn't guaranteed that it would be on the same floor. I was so pissed, but exhausted from this whole experience, we just had to take what was available. It was upsetting and embarrassing [for the bride to be - her first time really getting to enjoy a vegas trip and it started horribly] They offered a $100 food/drink credit to be used inside their hotel which was useless to us.   The next day, they were able to get us the 2 double queen rooms we were looking for, not adjoining rooms but on the same floor - which was fine. They sent us up some chocolates and a hand written note, that was a nice gesture but could never make up for the experience. This also doesn't make up for booking for Qty 2 double queen rooms and having to pay that same price but getting only 1 king bed on the first night [they should have credited the bill proportionate to the 1 king size room for that room for that night to keep a repeat customer] Sad to say, that I can never ever stay here again."
2454,train,0,"**Casino Only**  Have never stayed here but been here a few times over the past,  The casino is older and like most has the same slot machines.  Convenient to all the action of the Fremont Street Experience.  You get the old Vegas feel that I like. And one of the best restaurants is located here! Hugo's Cellar! A must go to restaurant. Check their reviews on their page!   There is no glitz like the hotels on the strip but it is ok if your going in to go to dinner or do the casino stuff.  I think the casino is a bit more smokier smelling than some but remember it is a older casino and your not on the strip!  They do have entertainment here and I HIGHLY recommend you going to see ~ Spirit of the King, starring Elvis Artist, Steve Connolly. He Is here entertaining. I have seen him perform and he is amazing! So if your wanting to see a good Elvis Artist you will like Steve!! Make sure if you stay here to see him!"

The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem."
8543,train,1,"Anytime I'm on vacation in another city, I try and do these sightseeing tours. I believe it's a good way to see what your city has to offer, especially if it's your first time or you're not familiar with the city. On my second to last day, I decided to look on Groupon and look for activities and they had a voucher for various options for the tour. I opted for the one day hop on, hop off for two ($40). They had additional options which included an extra day with lunch or a ticket to CSI experience.  There was a bus stop not too far from the hotel and we took the one hour ride from the strip through out Vegas, got some knowledge of Vegas, saw some greats sights, and some not so great sights in the Downtown part of Vegas which appeared to be a bit sketchy.  I would say it's definitely a good idea if you're a first timer in Vegas like myself and hop on and hop off and see the town!  P.S. Don't forget to tip the drivers!"

7492,train,1,Best view. Best food. I love the restaurants and on occasion stay if I'm looking for a fun break. The best time to pick up the Bellagio view is around 3pm when the fountains go off. It's right by the Crystals which is the best shopping extravaganza in Las Vegas.

1476,train,0,"Ok....I believe in giving a balanced assessment of a property when I yelp because I'd want nothing less when I read a review of a potential place to stay .   That said, my stay at country Inn was a mixed bag ...not a nightmare but there's definately room for improvement here   *management take note*  THE GOOD: *It's convenient to the airport * free  24 hr shuttle service to and from airport * friendly staff * suites are moderately priced , nicely appointed and spacious * free internet!! * free freshly baked cookies and coffee at reception area  * complimentary breakfast   THE BAD *water in the shower NEVER got hot (grrrrrrr) * unsupervised kids made noise at the pool well past 1030  with a hotel attendant right there!  I even observed the shuttle driver walk over to the attendant and asked him to quiet them down as it was late and some guests may be trying to sleep ...the hotel employee walked over to the pool on his phone and just continued his chat .....never admonishing the kids and simply walked back to where he was chatting  .....reallllly???)  Consequently, these are all fixable things and the good outweighed the bad for me so I'm giving country Inn  suites 3 stars"
5234,test,-1,Avoid at all costs. This place is a dump.   my company was late making reservations for CES and the only thing left was Hooters. How bad could it be?  The first room they gave me was filthy. While standing between the beds talking on the phone to the front desk to say the room wasn't acceptable my shoe stuck to the rug. The 2nd room was just as bad. The 3rd room had a new carpet. However there were bugs in the room so I wasn't staying in there.   Finally they upgraded me to a suite. Their idea of a suite is two filthy rooms. This one was the best so far so I stayed. The shower in the bedroom looked sketchy so I used the one in the living room. The drain was slow. Not a big deal until I flushed the toilet and it backed up into the tub.   The rooms all had old TVs with tubes. The one in the suite bedroom worked for about 5 min then turned RED.

The guitar music at the lounge was unbelievable. I'd go there just for the music!  Saw Iced Tea and Coco filming their reality TV show ""Ice loves Coco"" at dinner. It was like a normal occurrence to have lights, those reflectors, and 3 camera operators hanging out at dinner. No one blinked an eye... well except for us. I tried to get ice to hold a sign up for our missing friend Cindy that said ""Where's Cindy?"" so we could take a photo... no go (giggle.)"
1394,train,-1,Typical 24 hour diner-style restaurant. And this place is in connection to Pho at The Coffee Shop next door...Oh gosh I can't imagine how awful that would be!   Anyway it is good The Coffee Shop is at the TI. My girls and I stayed here and whenever us and our new found friends wanted to eat we just came here because it was open after the club !   The food options late at night are limited...I guess breakfast is what everyone goes for! Got the Ham & Cheese Omelette and was sort of disappointed how the cheese was literally a slice of Kraft's Cheddar Cheese just placed onto the omelette...It didn't even melt all the way....  The taste of the food is so bland. Lacks tons of flavor and I didn't feel like anything was wow about this place.   Mehh.... Go to the Grand Luxe Cafe across the street! Much better.
3493,train,1,"This is an amazing resort! I came here for a wedding, and they did an amazing job. The food was outstanding, the service was excellent, and they set up everything for a fun party.  The really outstanding part are the views, which are insane.  It is pretty expensive to get a room here, but I would come again for the restaurant and bar, as that is where you get the views."

I'm not sure how this came up as a 4 star hotel in my business travel service, but this is more akin to a motel."
8677,train,-1,Beware!!!! The Rita suite isn't a place you want stay. They have bugs and the furniture is very old dirty and saggy. They do have a kitchen kit that you can use but definitely had to wash again. The day staff wasn't very friendly. Check inn was at 4p. We had to sit there until 4:30p because our room wasn't ready. We couldn't sleep comfortable. We ended up checking out at 4am. But our stay was supposed to be 2days. I cannot remember the night guys name but he was really nice. But this is an overall nasty place. I'm so glad my kids wasn't with me. I really don't normally give reviews. But I had to. This is the worsest place we ever stayed.
2972,train,-1,Stayed here for a weekend.  Building is so run down.  Building has to be 50 years old.  Looks like they bought the building with old tvs and old furniture in it and slapped the Hooter logo on it. Was expecting the same experience I get when I have gone to their restaurants.  The AC in the room was so loud from the rattling all night.  We called rooms service for some late night food but after waiting 45 min I called and they told me they lost my order.  Staying at a motel 6 would have been better.
5725,train,1,"A stunning, fancy, and beautifully put together hotel!! Absolutely pricey so definitely up to you if you want to pay that much for a room you will hardly stay at since your in Vegas.

9965,train,1,"HotelRED is in a really nice location - close to coffee shops, shopping, and some eats.   And the rooms are quite lovely. They are spacious enough to include a kitchenette and the minibar is one of the most impressive I've seen in a hotel. It's definitely a modern design with almost everything feeling new, from the giant king-sized bed to the showerhead and sprayers in the bathroom. I was worried upon entering when I saw that the floor was basically concrete, without carpet, about how cold it might be, but my fears were for nothing because even in the dead of Madison winter the room was toasty warm.  Due to a flight cancellation I was only able to stay one night in the hotel, but the staff were so kind and accommodating that they accepted my late cancellation without a charge due to the inclement weather.  Free coffee in the lobby in the a.m. until 9 ish and a restaurant onsite all add up to a pretty nice hotel package. If you are looking for a hotel in this part of Madison you can't go wrong with HotelRED."
1967,train,1,"This is one of this pleasurable places you can only hope to stay at.  I was able to bring my kids here and have an enjoyable stay.  We arrived late in the afternoon, which was fine, but knowing the area I was expecting to have long lines to check in, of course this was not the case.  The front desk personal were very friendly and helpful to everybody in my group, this would including giving us water after our long trip and some needed restrooms too, that was pointed out for them to use.  After doing all the paperwork, we were directed to the location of our room, which was a very nice two bedroom condo.  The places was clean, and well maintained.  This place looked like it could have used a small update, but in general I have been to other places that still looked like the dÃ©cor was still in the 70's.  This was not the case here, the washer/dryers were a big plus, this is why we did not pack to heavy as I could do laundry here.  The kitchen was clean, the restroom were very clean, the bedroom were very nice and clean.  The pool area and all other common areas were very well maintained and should invite you to come back for another stay.  The strip is 3/4 of a mile away which is not too bad, but when you main focus is not the casinos, then this place is great.  We were able to do so many attraction both away from the strip and on the strip.    You have plenty of places to eat close by, not within walking distance but close enough to jump in the car and get what you need, including a 4 for less store."
7104,train,1,"After some consideration, the property seems in line with it's neighbors at City Center, namely Vdara, Aria (have yet to stay at the Mandarin, however I still prefer the Bellagio in this little quadrant of Lost Wages because of the overall effect it has on me.   Don't get me wrong, the Cosmo is more hip and fun and I can walk quickly over to PH for a great sammich at Earl's, however, after catching the fountain show over three straight hours from every possible location around Bellagio, including during dinner on the balcony, Bellagio is still the total package and quintessential Vegas weekend destination... Cosmo is a great interlude though... more of a what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas place.  Don't forget to ask for a terrace suite with a clear view of the fountains. It's worth it. :o)  Cheers!"
754,train,1,Recently stayed at this resort and had a great time!   Pros: - It's absolutely beautiful - and feels like an oasis.  - The staff were extremely attentive and on top of their game. - Walk in showers are awesome! - Beds are some of the best I've ever slept in.  Cons: - Was annoyed that one of the pools was closed for a private event. Seems like paying guests should have access to all areas or be told up front.
1110,train,1,"I had my wedding at this hotel, and it was awesome! First of all, about half of our guests came from NY, so you know they're picky. They were still talking about how great the food was months after our wedding. The hotel grounds are very well kept, and the place always looks immaculate. Best of all, the staff catered to our every need. They were actually anticipating what we might need and getting it to us before we had to ask. They sent my husband beer and snacks and a personal note the morning of the wedding while he was getting ready with his groomsmen, and they brought what was left of our cake out to us in the lobby the day after the wedding so we could sit there with our family and eat it right there in the lobby. I've never had such amazing service anywhere. (Oh, and during the wedding, they took my bouquet and all my bridesmaids bouquets and laid them all around our room, like around the tub, and they had strawberries and champagne waiting for us -- such a nice touch.) I HIGHLY recommend this place for hosting any occasion."
4086,train,-1,"Not the best but not the worst hotel I've been to. Like any typical hotels in Vegas, it's filled with games & slot machines everywhere & even the cashiers were trying to hustle us for room money saying we reserved 5 rooms instead of 3 & tried to make us pay more so they can fill up their rooms. Big no no so I'm subtracting a star from their original 3 stars. The bell boy was helpful during our initial arrival there...the hotel wasn't too close or too far from the strip bit it did take a bit of a walk to get there.  The hotel room itself was neat and didn't give me rashes like the low end motels I've been to so that's a good sign. Toilet flushed slow because we were on the 18th floor but it's whatever...the view was mediocre & it's ironic how they named it ""Ocean View"" when all we see are the pools below & ""Bay View"" when it's the view of the strip itself...not much of a ""view"" if you ask me.  The bed was comfy to sleep in and I did get good night sleep there. A/C runs smoothly and saved our asses from the Nevada heat. Other than it being the Hooters Hotel it was just pretty much resembling your typical Hooters restaurant because the waitresses there wear their Hooters uniform and services you as they would at their own restaurant. Nothing too out of the extraordinary & it's definitely a good alternative if you want a cheaper hotel to stay at in Vegas."
9986,train,-1,"Review for the BAR only:  Oh gosh. For a moderately upscale place that does so well with its rooms and overall service, the bar service and the bartenders couldn't be more clueless. They're nice people, but desperately need training in very basic skills. A few immediate things to fix:  1. ALWAYS USE A STRAINER. Ice chunks (resulting from piss-poor bartending form) in any martini-style drink is unacceptable. This isn't even a ""craft cocktail"" thing. It's a basic thing. If you use a shaker and a glass to strain a $10 drink, you don't know what you're doing.  2. STOP SAMPLING DRINKS WITH STRAWS IN FRONT OF PATRONS. So you mix a drink (presumably from a recipe) and dip a (presumably clean) cocktail straw into it to pull a sample? Really? Wow.  3. UNDERSTAND AND MEMORIZE YOUR OWN RECIPES. An order from YOUR OWN DRINK MENU shouldn't be baffling.  4. VIRTUALLY EVERY DRINK SHOULD BE GARNISHED. When was the last time you saw an Old Fashioned properly served without any type of garnish whatsoever? Yep...NEVER.  5. LEARN HOW TO MEASURE. We watched as our two drinks poured out to about one and a half, at which point a few splishes of additional ingredients went into the shaker to top them off. OK, you can be off by a little, but not by half a drink. Again, probably just bad training and inexperience.  I'm sure this group is fine with more student-oriented drinks like beer. But if you're going to offer a higher end experience, specialty drinks and higher prices (which are all perfectly fine and appreciated in the heart of UW Student Central), you need more skills than just dumping vodka in some type of mixer.  We'll wait a while and try again."
6680,train,1,"I heard the Cosmopolitan was great, but I was still surprised and impressed.  Simply a fantastic hotel with a great location and even better service.  I had a 55th floor room overlooking the Bellagio fountain.  Great view overall!  There are also rooms with a balcony (single king) and suites.  The bathrooms are chic, the decor is modern, the amenities are upscale, and every bit of service I received was simply top notch.  The casino here may not be as big as some of the other Vegas big names, but you can find everything from slots to blackjack to war, so there is plenty of diversity.  The restaurant selection is great, and both pools are wonderful.  I didn't get a chance to check out Marquee, but it seems like everyone has a great time there.  If you want to be/feel hip and stay in a really nice hotel (but aren't throwing gold bars around just yet) then the Cosmopolitan is definitely the place to be!"
143,test,-1,"Unfortunately, our last one-day visit on September 17th to this property was marred because (1) our ""Guaranteed"" roll-in shower room was provided to another guest, (2) we were not notified in advance regarding this room issue, and (3) David (Assistant GM) refused to honor Fairfield Inn's ""100 percent Satisfaction Guaranteed Policy.""  As a result, my wife was unable to shower during our stay.  David's lack of compliance is particularly disturbing due to Marriott's ""best in industry"" long-standing policy to make special efforts regarding the accommodation of disabled guests.   Otherwise, our stay was fine - comfortable bedding, immaculate facility/breakfast area and a great pool/spa area.  A special acknowledgement is also extended to Jane (Front Desk) due to her stellar customer-centric skills and experience - she is an asset to the Marriott and H&A Group brands."
327,train,0,"Having stayed at a lot of upscale hotels, I think Montelucia is a great property although it needs some tune-ups.  It's very spacious and in a very nice location close by Camelback Mountain. I believe it was owned by another hotel and has had an extensive makeover, according to friends who live nearby. Our room in building 12 was very comfortable and very quiet. The bed was really soft, and we had a nice flat screen TV. Wi-Fi worked well.  The carpet was in desperate need of cleaning and made you feel like walking barefoot could be unsanitary. And unlike most hotels where the shampoo and soaps are replenished daily, this hotel did not. For an upscale property, this seemed kind of penurious.  You do have to be careful with charges. The basic brunch was very nice (including bagels, smoked salmon and other fare, but if you added warm food like eggs or bacon, you'll get charged twice as much.I had a very nice massage but was surprised a 20% gratuity was automatically added. That was exorbitant and unnecessary.  All that being said, all staff was incredibly friendly, competent and helpful. In fact I can't recall any hotel where every employee worked so hard for their guests.   Excellent staff, and nice accommodations that could be easily improved with some effort."

7678,train,-1,"I would have to say that our experience at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas was the worst hotel experience I have ever had and I have a vague memory of staying at a dumpy hotel with a spring popping out of the mattress when I was an infant. And, for some reason my memory has no sheets on the mattress, Yes, Cosmopolitan was worse than that. Less than 24 hours there and a disaster of a stay.  After some time at the Trump International we decided to check out Cosmopolitan. Trump was becoming too relaxing and we were feeling like we needed more of a night life and a few more restaurant choices. Judging by the commercials it was beautiful and everyone was glamorous and happy.  We pulled into the valet and dropped off our bags with the attendant since there wasn't a bellman available - hmmmmm. Lately, check in times have been at 3pm - 1. This is because they have no house keeping, 2. because they want you to roam the casino and spend money gambling, eating, and drinking, extremely irritating! We got there at 1pm, knowing that they could add us to the queue for a room and we would just grab a drink and something to eat while waiting.  The front desk took down our cell number, verified the number and promised to call us back at 3pm. Well; it was 315 and no phone call. Annoyed, we walked back across the casino and waited in line for someone at front desk. By the way, as we were walking still no phone call.  The guy at front desk was very friendly, but it took more time to put us in a room. After he typed away for some time he issued us $150 room and beverage credit. That was nice of them.  Prior to departing the front desk we asked for them to send up our bags. We got to our room about 4:00, waited 15 min for our bags, called and complained. We finally got them 45 minutes later. Ahhh, glad that's over. Now time to start our vacation!  What's a little speed bump, just about to relax at 5pm and embark on our obsession with in-room movies when disaster strikes! You guessed it, unable to order in-room movies! Thank God the phone works so that we can call and complain about everything! Turns out they never checked us into the room completely. Since no one could solve the problem the manager got on the phone. With a flip of a switch, problem solved, turns out we have seen all the movies anyway. Ugh! Finally time for a quick nap before dinner.   I was super excited that this beautiful room was not only equipped with a full kitchen, but also a washer and dryer. I desperately needed to get the wrinkles out of my top, so I decided to ghetto iron my shirt by throwing a damp cloth in the dryer with my top. Who needs the steamy, right? Immediately after doing so I realized that I threw them into the washer instead of the dryer, no problem I thought. Wrong! This washer absolutely refused to open. I'm pretty even tempered, but by this time I wanted to find a blunt object and bash in the washer! Frustrated, and having less than an hour to get ready, I got on the phone again. The front desk representative told me that the washer door would not open unless I run a cycle. Ugh, that wasn't gonna happen! So, she told me engineering will be up ASAP to open it. 15 min later and no engineering and let me tell you, I wasn't surprised! I called again, another 15 min passes still no engineering. Again, 15 min later still no engineering! I was going to have to take this into my own hands, meaning we Googled it and found the user manual. I guess this means I am an engineer.   Flustered, I threw on my top and we headed out to meet our friends at Milos, the Greek restaurant located on the property. None of us knew how to get there and the nonexistent hotel staff and security wasn't making it any easier. There is a God, the service and the food was excellent. We will definitely be going back to Milos. After over stuffing ourselves we headed to the closest bar and had a couple drinks. We would have loved to stay a bit longer, but our food coma was slowly killing us. We couldn't wait to crawl into bed and crash. Massively Bloated ;) and sleepy we made it down the 300 degree hallway, only to find that our damn key cards didn't work! SERIOUSLY! By now I have reached my breaking point. Oh, should I say ""boiling point"" since the hallway is easily over 80 degrees. With that said, I stared down the endless hallway, took a deep breath of the humid hallway air, and embarked on the Bataan death march to the front desk. Shockingly one person was working the front desk and there was a line, we are talking DMV dejavu  This may come as a bit of a shock, but the next morning decided to check out, just had enough. I mean, what's next! Is the roof going to cave in on us! Even checking out the next morning was a 30 minute disaster on the phone trying to figure out how to apply the two credits we were given....  continued on my blog...."

Slots A Fun is the exact opposite of its glitzy Strip casinos. its small and grungy, and the crowd isn't exactly glamorous (almost creepy), but if you're looking for some cheap fun. you'll find it here."
8598,test,-1,I'm always focused when I come here. I have a goal hit the movies up for popcorn and head to the poker table. The dealer does not shuffle the card fair enough for me. They do it like a 5 year old just lay the cards on the table and mix em around a bit and then while this takes place they talk to people who come often. Hey Jimmy how ya been? How's the wife and kids? Then the cards are dealt and Jimmy gets a Full House and the dealer gets a tip. (Its easy to see why I am not crazy about this.) It looks at if Jimmy has the dealer in his pocket. So I wont return anytime soon. Now I know that the casinos does a good job of watching people who cheat but I have a uneasy feeling so I wont return. I know that people at times can get to know a dealer we all have poker names just when a dealer is overly friendly to one but does not do any talking to others it makes me wonder.   I sat thru 2 games a day for almost a week. And I have to say I will just go where no one knows anyone's name. I'm a good poker player Id say about 60% to 65% I just think its something wrong when I sit down and I only win one hand the whole game. I can play in a alley and have better odds. They get two stars from me because the popcorn is good. And I often chill at the side stores and that's fun.
2119,test,1,"There's definitely a reason so many girls have their bachelorette parties at The Cosmo.  Rooms here are spacious and classily decorated, the bathroom is huge, and there are a ton of mirrors to accommodate a ton of girls getting ready for a night out in Vegas.  Service was awesome here.  We came back one afternoon and our room REEKED of marijuana.  One call to the front desk and someone was immediately up in our room spraying air freshener.  They later brought in an air purifier once we were out of the room to get rid of the smell.  The one pool I went to was really pretty.  The gym was okay.  It definitely has all the basic cardio and weightlifting equipment you need, but the view out the window was kind of gross (a rooftop/wall of another building, if I remember correctly).  Didn't get to go to their day or night clubs, so super bummed about that.  - 1 star for their ""Wi-fi.""  I could NEVER get it to connect until I called their IT person, which was a pain."
958,train,0,"What is up with all the restaurants closing at 10? I was planning to go have dinner at ISLA in the Treasure Island but we got there at 10pm (closing time) I had a few other places in mind but I called before and they were also closed WTF!!!  This was the only place that was opened late at TI. Didn't feel like getting our car from valet and looking for another place so we settled here. We had to wait in a line outside to get seated for like 20+min. There seemed to be only 3 people waiting on tables so it took a long time to get our drinks, food,etc.  Heeelllooo mgmt, if this is the only place that's opened late and is obviously crowded, why are there only 3 people serving?!?!?!?"
2027,train,1,What's not to like?  Incredible attention to detail and very service oriented.  It's nice and quiet so if you have a family and money isn't an issue then it's amazing.  They have deals on their website too for upgrades or 3rd night free so definitely check that out before you book at the usual travel sites.
5471,train,1,"I'll try to be brief.  Visited Vegas for the first time last weekend and decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan.  Was there with a friend from Friday night to Monday morning.  I loved it!!  We were given a ""City View"" room with 2 Queen beds and the guy at the desk gave us options for which floor.  The room had a great view of part of the Strip to the left and mountains to the right (and the airport too).  It was perfectly large with super comfy beds and lots of pillows.  The bathroom is the nicest hotel bathroom I've ever used.  The stall-type shower is huge with a glass door on one side and a floor-to-ceiling window on the other side.  That window looked into the sleeping area but had blinds so you could decide if you were feeling voyeuristic or not...or if you just wanted to watch tv while you showered I guess.  The vanity section had double sinks and there was a separate toilet area...for those who care about that sort of thing.  I'm normally a frequenter of hotels in the Days Inn price range so this room was a real step up for me...but if you're going to go to Vegas, you might as well splurge a little and do it right!  It will be tough to go back to the economy hotels now.    This place is beautiful and trendy.  It is modern but with a classic, throwback twist.  The decor is sleek but the details are old-school:  40s & 50s influences in some of the decor are in lots of places in the hotel.  From retro phones and sofas in the lobby to framed photos of pin-ups in the hallways, there is definitely a sexy, vintage vibe overlaying the sleek modernity of the place.  The lobby features ever changing video columns that correspond to videos in the elevators.  The Vesper bar in the lobby is glittery and classy.  The Chandelier bar is a 3-story bar inside a crystal chandelier - yes, inside.  Each of the 3 levels has different signature drinks so you can have a different experience at each level if you wish.  My friend & I tried a couple of the drinks on 2 of the levels and all were very tasty and well made.    We knew we wanted to see a couple of shows while we were in Vegas so we opted to have the concierge take care of the tickets for us.  During the weekend, we spoke to 2 different concierges and both were incredibly nice and helpful.  They got us exactly what we wanted and we even got a great discount for one of the shows we saw.  The hotel has so many great restaurants, it would be easy just to do all your dining on site.  We had breakfast twice at The Henry which is by the casino downstairs at the entrance to the Strip.  The food was fantastic and hearty and the staff was attentive (but not too much) and wonderful.  We had dinner at Holstein's on our first night there (exhausted from traveling & very hungry) and weren't disappointed. I'm going to save my detailed comments about those places for my actual reviews of them rather than waste time here.  I'm not going to say much about the casino here because that wasn't my main reason for choosing this hotel.  It seemed to me to be a pretty standard casino.  However, it does have a section in which girls dance on the bars during the course of the evening.  I didn't see that in other casinos so if that's your thing, there ya go.  There are shops in one of the towers (same tower as the restaurants and casino) and the building connects via covered walkway over the street to The Aria next door.  From there you can walk via another over street walkway to The Mandarin or you can take a tram to a couple of the other nearby hotels which is convenient.  Generally speaking, I loved this place.  It is not a family-friendly place, in my opinion (which I'm good with since I don't have kids).  It seems to cater more toward the young professional through to the slightly less young professional (that'd be my age group).  I liked the details and the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and genuine.  The only negatives I can really comment on were the less than clean hallway carpet and the apparent length of time it takes to come pick up room service trays/carts.  There were a couple of times I saw trays/carts outside of rooms on my hallway and they would sit there for hours and hours...overnight in one case.  I would say it is pricey, but I knew what I was getting into so that is a non-issue.  Oh, and random fact:  the bedside table didn't contain a Bible, but had a book of erotic Japanese art instead.  And, clearly I didn't succeed in being brief."
925,train,-1,"This is my third visit here and it will be my last. Checked in and went to my room on the third floor and my room key didn't work. So had to drag all my luggage back down to the front desk and get it reprogrammed.  Desk clerk acted as if it was an imposition that he had to do it.  Four days into my stay I'm out and about and I get a phone call from my credit card company to tell me that the hotel has attempted to charge my card six times for differing amounts above and beyond the hold they put on the card at check in for the total amount of the stay. Since I didn't know anything about the additional charges they declined them and cancelled my card. Great. So I go back to the hotel and ask for an explanation of the additional charges and they have no idea what I'm talking about. The only charge they show is the initial one. I press the desk clerk further and she says I'll have to speak with the manager the next day and gives me her card. So I go to my room, and my key doesn't work again, so I have to go back down to the front desk and get it reprogrammed. Again, no sorry for the inconvenience from the desk clerk. So I go to my event and get back to my room about 3:39am. Since I'm checking out that day my bill has been slipped under my door.  I open it up and it's almost three times what was quoted and what I agreed to at check in. So back down to the front desk I go.  I show the clerk my reservation confirmation and bill. She looks them over and agrees that the bill is incorrect. Unfortunately she tells me that only the manager can correct the problem, and she will be in at 8:00am. So I go back to my room and get some sleep. Today is checkout day so I pack everything up and get down to the front desk about 9:00.  I ask for the manager and I'm told that she isn't there, she's out at a meeting and they don't know when she will be back. So I tell the clerk that I have a problem with my bill and that I was told that only the manager could deal with it. She gives me a really strange look and says she doesn't know why someone would tell me that. She takes my bill and reservation confirmation and says if I'll have a seat in the lobby she will get my bill corrected. Took her just a few minutes and she had my bill corrected. She also gave me an additional $50 credit due to the issues I had during my stay.  When I returned home I received an email requesting I fill out a survey about my stay.  I did that and within a short time I received a canned response from the hotel manager saying she was sorry I had a bad experience and that she hoped that involve them another chance.  Not likely.  It's really too bad because it's a nice facility, but it's run very poorly."
7586,test,-1,"After waiting in line to check-in for 45 minutes, I made the long treck to my room only to find out the key doesn't work. I called the hotel to see what was going on, after holding for 5 minutes I was td security will be up in a couple minutes. I have now been waiting for 10 minutes. I wanted to give this place a chance but it is back to Wynn for me next time."
7386,train,1,"Wonderful hotel with lots of ammenities but not all Marriott Rewards bennies available.  I was in LV for CES the 2nd week in January at the last minute I was moved to the Cosmopolitan.  What a treat!   - Loved the in-room technology where everything is run from the TV.  At night, through the TV, I would set the room to wakeup at 7am. Lights only in the bedroom to come on low, TV to turn on at low volume with Sirius Radio jazz station and the temperature to go up to 70 degrees. Awesome! - Restaurants were great and the breakfast buffet was fantastic and felt like a good deal at $15 compared to everything else nice on the strip.  - Service was great and I hope they keep it going.  Everytime I needed something they were quick to help.  I asked for a newspaper in the indoor poolside restaurant.  They didn't have any but the went and found me two! - My only real compaint was their integration with the Marriott hotel system was incomplete, no one seemed to know anything about how it should work.  I'm a high level Marriott Rewards member and entitled to certain benefits and according to the website the Cosmopolitan is part of the new Marriott ""Autograph Collection"" and the bennies are specifically called out for this group.  I was a little frustrated so I called the front desk to find out what was going on.  It took them about 30min to figure out that they are part of the Autograph Collection but also a ""Resort"" which most of the benefits don't apply.  Not clear at all on the website.  So, just a warning if you go as a Marriott Rewards member.  I will stay here again when I'm in Las Vegas."
1907,train,-1,"Pros: parking was easy and free, front desk and bellman were nice, the room was clean.  Cons: my non-smoking room made my eyes, nose, and throat burn so it seemed like a smoking room (?), I ended up on the Fremont side so it was super loud with live music until after midnight (even with ear plugs), the room was small and everything was dated, the bed was somewhat hard but ok but the pillows were awful and small.   We had a 2-night certificate that we won at a silent auction, so I didn't want to request another room, they had basically donated it. So I just left after 3 hours to switch hotels."
9104,train,1,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Boulder Station Hotel & Casino for 2 nights last week.   While I don't require staying in a 5-star hotel, I have pretty high standards when it comes to hotel stays.  I had stayed in a Station Hotel a couple years ago (Red Rock) and was looking for a lower priced room but still with a nice room.  I read a lot of reviews and looked at a number of hotels off the strip before choosing Boulder Station.  This trip was to attend an event in Vegas and we didn't want to stay on the busy strip and deal with throngs of people and bumper to bumper traffic.  I wasn't sure what to expect and was extremely pleased when we arrived and saw our room.  Self parking was easy and a very short walk to the elevator to the rooms.  Check in was quick, friendly and easy.  Our room was beautifully decorated, roomy and comfortable, and the bathroom had lots of space and counter space.  The bed was super comfortable, and there was no trace of stale cigarette smoke.  There wasn't much noise in the halls or from nearby rooms either.  My only criticisms are 1) there were only 2 pillows in for a king bed, with no spares 2) there were only 2 sets of towels for 2 people.  We took a shower after arriving and had to use damp towels for our morning showers. 3) There wasn't a spare blanket.  I realize a call to the front desk would have resolved any and all of those issues, but it would have been nice to have those items ready and waiting.  The casino was quite nice, and although people were smoking it didn't bother me much.  Their air control system must be really good!  There were a handful of restaurants to choose from for our meals, and they had plenty of security.  You had to flash your room key to a security guard to get onto the elevators to the rooms, which I think is a good idea.  It was quick and easy to come and go, and since we were off the strip we didn't have to deal with any traffic.  It was a very pleasant stay and we will stay there again in the future.  Good job  Boulder Station!"
9250,train,0,"This is a good place. Renovations made recently so that the rooms are clean, comfortable and nice. Restaurant is very decent. Daily complimentary breakfast that was very acceptable. It's steps away from the Eaton Centre and downtown core. If much of your activity is on the westside around King and University, you will be taking taxis. I recommend this hotel over many others in downtown TO."
4017,test,-1,the lobby and hall way smells.. but you cant blame them.. they're an older hotel.. the staff was nice.. especially one of the valet guys.. the corded phone in the room is just broken.. called a few times and they couldnt hear.. when they finally could we had asked for extra towels that never arrived.. had a hard time taking a shower.. the hot water was not hot enough and the shower made a really loud noise the whole time.. but at the end of the time.. you get what you pay for.. we didnt want to spend 150 a night at our regular spots.. it was 140 here for 2 nights! the powerball machine was really fun though..
8211,train,1,"Cosmo is a new, trendy hotel that has set a new (higher) standard for the younger crowd.  The hotel rooms are the best use of space I've seen so far on the strip. Not your typical layout of a bed, TV and bath- boring!!  Loved the sitting area, two flat screen tv's, open bathtub with spa jets, clear view into shower, open floor plan and balcony - all with quality materials and smartly decorated. I stayed in room 1630.   The pool was nothing short of off the hook. Waitresses were attentive, with great attitude and attractive. Music was current. Crowds were manageable. It was like being part of a pool party we see in hip magazines.   There was so much to do on the property that we never left.  All we had to do was bring a party attitude, Cosmo did the rest.  Definitely making a return visit. Till next time Cosmo. Keep a cold one chilled for me."

9650,train,-1,"This place is a dump.  When we booked it, they said all they had left was a smoking room.  Imagine my shock that smoking rooms still exist. When we arrived, no elevator so if you have heavy baggage good luck, the room reels of smoke, there was a cigarette burn on the bed spread, and the room was dirty. The whole place is very dated.  We thought we could handle the cigarette smoke, but my eyes started burning and my daughter couldn't breathe so we checked out after 4 hours. They are still charging me for two nights."
5046,train,1,My friends had stayed here and their room overlooked the Bellagio Fountains.  It's a great location in the center of the strip.  I highly recommend this place if you are visiting with friends not good for families.
2006,train,1,"Very nice, new property.  I have stayed in my share of Hampton Inns, this is one of my favorites.  I am getting fast internet connection instead of the anemic offering even though I am not a Diamond member.  There is Ethernet in the room so far down the hall rooms have good connection to the web as well.  Having in room recycling is a big draw for me.  There aren't restaurants within easy walking distance but I am sure it will change as the area is more built up.  The only downside is no courtesy van service to the airport which is inconvenient to those without a car."
1244,train,1,Really good shrimp cocktail...always stop to get some on our way to Lake Mead.
1323,train,1,"As others have said, I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this hotel and what it provided for the cost.  Loved that my room, and probably the other rooms as well, was a mini suite.  And I thought there were some nice touches in addition to the normal expectations: a dishwasher and microwave popcorn, along with a fridge and a nicely appointed bathroom.  Bed was quite comfortable, with lots of soft pillows.  Only negatives were: a noisy fridge-I ended up turning it off before I went bed and the light from the microwave was too bright for the room.  I couldn't find anything to cover the brightness.  I do wish there were more eating places within walking distance, but no biggie. Besides that, I enjoyed my stay.  Close to highway.  Would stay again."

9051,test,0,"Okay, I'm going to admit it-- I found out about this place when Googling rent-by-the-hour motels in Toronto.  The reviews weren't great, but it's superclose to where the boyfriend and I work and we just needed a place to go.   Background: we're full-fledged adults (albeit 'young' adults) with full-time jobs, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, and even a mortgage payment, but we have to act like teenagers often due to current circumstances. No, we're not married to other people; we just have conservative parents and neither of us lives alone at the moment. So we often need a place to go just for a few hours. Hotels get pricey and although the backseat of his car is surprisingly quite roomy, sometimes we just want a bit more privacy and to not do anything illegal.  My first thought was maybe a steambath would rent us a private room (for $20-25 a night), but no, they are all solely for the gay community, and there aren't even any co-ed nights. Hence, my Google search for motels.   So, I found us this gem of a place and suggested we check it out. The reviews weren't great, but the website said $50 for 4 hours and rates negotiable. So I thought maybe we could offer the guy $35 for three hours or some such deal, and go one evening after work. Yeah, I was pretty hard-up. I figured if we liked it enough, and the owner was willing to negotiate lower prices for shorter periods of time, maybe we could make it a regular thing-- perhaps even for a lunchtime rendezvous or two.   We called to make a reservation during our lunch break one day last week--the guy just took a name and time, and that was it (no credit card number or how long we'd be staying, which makes me think rooms were readily available). Swang by around 6:30 PM. The front doors of the place were wide open. You have to go up some very dingy-looking stairs to go to the hotel. The door there is locked, probably so the police don't break in. There's a sign posted with the rates and two numbers scrawled... the guy's cell is one of them; same number that's on the website that we'd called earlier. We called him, and he came in about 3 mins from outside, and we 'checked in'. And by checked in, I mean he asked to see ID, took $50 in cash (don't think this is on the site, but no credit or debit accepted obviously), and led us to the room. There is no reception desk or area; as soon as the locked door opens, you're in the hotel.    He did rip us off though-- he insisted it was $50 for 3 hours and $60 for 4, even though we showed him his sign right there that said $50 for four hours. Whatever, we were pretty desperate in case you didn't get that already, and we decided $50 for three hours was just fine.    There's AC, there's wi-fi, there're people who are probably prostitutes (we saw exactly one person other than the owner). We also did not see but heard the couple in the room next to us-- they were having a very loud argument about whether to stay for the full-month. There is a discounted rate of $35/night if you commit to 30 days, but one part of the couple was evidently not happy with the place. How did we hear them? Could be the walls were thin, but they were also shouting and we were in the hallway at that point leaving our room. Maybe they heard us too-- I'm not sure, but there was nobody around when we 'checked out' at around 9:30 PM. And by checked out, I mean we just walked out.   As for the room we had: it wasn't great, but it did the job. There was a queen-sized bed, a table with two chairs, a mini-fridge, and sink and a bathroom which came with two towels, a body wash, shampoo, and toilet paper. It wasn't very clean, but it also wasn't very dirty. There may or may not be bedbugs. I'm posting some pictures.   So yeah, it's shady but was that $50 worth it? Oh, yes.  Would I go to the Jun Jun Hotel again and again for short-term rentals? Probably not.  A lot of it was just about the novel experience. And I was really hoping the guy would be more flexible in his negotiating.  So yeah, we can think ""Oh, rent by the hour? Prostitution!"" or we can think ""Hmmm, rent by the hour? Must be some people who are badly in need of that service."" Or both.  They have love hotels in Japan where homes are small and people live in extended families. Maybe there's a market for this in Toronto now?   3 stars for the ease of the experience."

The accommodations are stunning. The service is second to none. The breakfast included is delicious. But the best thing is the people... They treat us like family, they care, they are what sold us the very first time to return. Each trip we go with HIGH expectations and we are never disappointed. In fact we are blown away each time!

The bars in the Cosmo are classy and the day clubs are pumping, love the Cosmo feel."
6485,train,-1,"Stayed here for a business trip. It's an older building that has been remodeled. The rate was reasonable for the services provided, but the building has a serious problem with people smoking in it. The ventilation is very poor, and so people who violate the No Smoking policy cause issues for non-smokers in other rooms. On multiple occasions I had a smoke smell overpower my room, but had no idea where it was coming from. It cleared from the main room within a few minutes, but lingered in the bathroom the rest of the night. The staff informed me strongly on sign-in that there was a no smoking policy, and so it seems they're aware of the problem but powerless to do anything to fix it. I eventually complained about it, and they moved me to another room. This seemed fine, until the weekend. At that point, several people went out drinking, and returned at 3:30 in the morning. Which would have been fine, if they weren't slamming doors, talking on the phone in the hallway, and otherwise being pretty loud. I had a flight that morning and needed to be up at 6:30. Not a good recipe for sleep!"

The wings (911 and 3mile) 's sauce was almost gritty like sand in texture and the celery was limp.  The battered shrimp were rather soggy too (as if they were not frozen all the way thru prior to cooking)  Not a great one, but from what I learned not a francise - one of the 'staple' locations.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Accomodations are well worth everything. The room was a double bed and plenty of space to move around. They had a microwave which was such a big plus since I'll be here for an entire week for a convention. Flat screen tv and cable. The bathroom was also spacious and nice. They offer Neutrogena products. Everything is so clean.  Also, they offer a shuttle to the convention center but also, I walked there every morning in about 30 minutes. It was a safe and pleasant walk.  I was quite pleased."
9975,train,-1,"Had decided to meet friends for a drink and light supper.The first problem at Hotel Red/The Wise is parking: almost impossible. I have heard that one can park behind the building, but signage suggests that only guests of the hotel can park there and I didn't want to take a chance of getting towed. Parked on the street and took my life in my hands getting across the Monroe/Regent crazy intersection at rush hour. Yikes. Don't try that drunk. The staff at The Wise was cheerful to a fault, but they didn't seem to have a clue what was going on. There was confusion about the menu, but finally a long list of substitutions appeared -- ha ha, ""just off the press (it literally was still warm). Our server tried to explain it but even she was confused. Easily a third of the small plates were not available. We finally settled on one of them and also ordered a large-plate: the Fondue, which sounded like a great thing to share among the 3 of us. Perfect, right? It would have been, but... it ""wasn't available."" Huh?? If we hadn't already ordered and gotten our drinks, I would have walked at that point. To their credit, they did bring us a complimentary small plate assortment of meat/cheese roll-ups, which were delicious. Overall the vibe was ""not prepared to receive guests."" I'll have to be strongly persuaded to go back.  A final note:  This building is hands-down the ugliest structure in Madison - which already has the UW Humanities Building high on that list. Hotel Red has nothing to do with the architecture of the neighborhood around it and looks as though it's not finished."
7720,train,1,"We have stayed another 3 times since my last review so heres an update:  Most recent stay was over New Years week 2015/16 (Arrived on December 30th, departed on Jan 4th).  Service was great from the Concierge and other employees we encountered, as it always has been.  The housekeeping staff was polite and friendly, leaving a couple extra towels at my request and remembering to do so on each service for the duration of our stay.  My removal of one star after this visit is due to the cleaning of the rooms.  This was a last-minute trip for us, and the rooms we normally would book were already taken for our arrival date.  No big deal, we took what they had and dealt with it.    The first room (City Room) just seemed kind of ""grimy"".  Not really dirty, but certainly not as clean as we normally find upon arriving at The Cosmo... and our friends were in the adjoining room, so that was nice to be so close since they hadnt stayed here before.  Then we got our friends moved into a Terrace Suite so they could see a variety of the rooms offered here (and have a little more room to move about while in).  Again, it just wasnt as clean as our past visits have brought us to expect when arriving here.    For our last night we were moved into the adjoining room (again) of our friends in the Terrace Suite.  There was dried puke splatter on the wall in the bathroom, the shower heads were coated and plugged with calcium/hard water particles, among a few other things that were simply unexpected at a place I have stayed so many times at and raved about the cleanliness and service to my friends at home.  I was almost embarrassed that we had brought our friends here instead of The Four Seasons.    Hopefully this was just a fluke on a very busy Holiday season, but really thats no excuse to only halfway do your job... (Aimed at Housekeeping)."
89,train,-1,"Slots a fun is a gambling hall dating back to what smaller LV gaming was like before in the 70s and 80s. Giving you a different feel, people came for the $1 hot dogs and you have a definitely younger feel at the casino here than the major ones on the strip. I remember coming here 15 years ago when I couldn't afford the $15 -$25 minimums of the main casinos for table games and you could enjoy blackjack or the other games for $2 a hand or $5 a hand. It would get rowdy here with the younger crowd and drink specials as the night went on! Now it's looking a little more tired as it ages and you wonder how much longer they can keep a go at it before the wrecking ball or dynamite blows the place up. The N end of the strip will be revitalized I. The next 10-20 years as the boom comes back and then the property here will be worth a lot. Till the it's an aging casino that has seen many a wild night and we shall see how long it lasts!"
8623,train,0,Rooms are very nicely remodeled and spacious. Pool was hot!!!  Not sure if that's do to still heating it during the summer or lack of aerators but not refreshing. Unfortunately they do not have any wait service at the pool. You have to order from the fourth floor lounge. This is something they should definitely rectify. Nearly every adult at the pool mentioned the lack of pool service. Breakfast was hot and they have made to order omelettes.

In a nut shell:  (These are 2 different occasions)   Checked in at ARIA, left after 24 hrs Checked in at MGM, left after 24 hrs  Reason being... It wasn't like the COSMO!!!   I'll never stay anywhere else. Always a pleasure, thank you COSMO!!!"
4930,train,1,"Our third stay at the Cosmopolitan.  Love the suit room.  We are traveling with a 10 months old and being able to let her sleep while, we are watching TV in a different room is awesome.  In a room overlooking Bellagio fountains - best view we ever.  The negatives 1) housekeeping is spotty, asked for the room to be cleaned - came back 1.5 hours later and they were just starting (with a baby kind of a big deal) when they did clean the room, they missed our bath tab. 2) in room dinning has fewer choices, I've seen in a long time.  But what we did get what nice.  Another plus, rooms are very quite, our room is across from the elevators and we don't hear anything, also no annoying knocks on a door at 7:45am insisting on made service."
2633,train,1,"An oasis from the noise of Las Vegas. The best hotel experience we have had in Vegas by far. The staff was attentive yet somehow almost invisible, how they do that is a mystery I cannot explain. When you need them they seem to appear, when you want to be alone you are. Fantastic to experience.   The rooms are all high floors in the Mandalay Bay. Ours had a strip view which was great. Surreal to be able to watch to strip at night in total silence. Turn down service and cleaning was excellent. They never missed anything and left our room spotless every time. Bedding and furniture was high end as should be expected in a Four Seasons.  Close to the convention center in the Mandalay via a side door to the Mandalay lobby and casino so there is no problem getting from your tranquility to the action whenever you want.   One special thing is the valet service, having had my car in valet service in several hotels in Vegas this one is top of the heap. If you call from your room they have your car ready by the time you get to the door. They always had cold bottled water in the cupholder ready for our trip and asked if we needed directions to anywhere every time we took out the car. Truly the best valet service I have experienced."
5297,train,0,"Stayed here over St. Patty's Day weekend with a girlfriend for a girl's weekend.  We normally stay at Harrah's properties for free but decided to switch it up when I got a comp offer for Cosmo which included a free room, $300 in food and $400 in free play.  Was not a huge fan of this place, even though the property itself is nice.    We had a resv for a terrace suite with 2 queen beds.  The lady who checked us in told me she was ""upgrading"" me to a terrace suite with a king bed.  Well, when I told her I should already have a terrace suite but with two queens (and I showed her the resv on paper from their resv dept) she told me that was impossible because the room didn't exist with queen beds.  I was very confused how that could happen and asked lots of questions!  A king bed with a pullout bed was not going to work for us ladies (I had just been to the chiropractor for a bad back/neck - wasn't sleeping on a pullout bed!!).  She kept insisting that there is not a terrace suite with 2 queen beds and then finally admitted that ""ok,...there ARE terrace suites with queen beds, but there are none available right now"".  Ok, well that's a different story!  So we ended up in a ""regular"" room, no terrace with a city view.  That was fine, although we were looking forward to the terrace suite and the experience.  Our room overlooked the Bellagio water show and was ok.     Ordered room service on our first AM in the room and the service was spectacular.  My friend had a hangover and mentioned it to the woman who set up our room service and she said she would take care of it with the bell desk.  Soon after, the bell desk called us and double checked we wanted some aspirin from the gift shop and indeed it was delivered like magic soon thereafter.  Very nice!  This place is THE place for the clubbers and those in the 20 something age category,   So if this fits your likes, you are going to LOVE Cosmo.  I am not a clubber and beyond that age by 20 years now.  :-)  So on the weekend we saw lots of girls that looked like they had made their way over to this place in their hoochie mama dresses and stripper heels on fake id's.  That was interesting to walk through as we made our way to/from the casino and to/from our room.  Somewhat entertaining....  We didn't get to experience much of this place, outside of the gift shop, lobby bar and some slot machines.  Not enough time during St. Patty's Day weekend.  It's definitely a beautiful place but I felt out of my ""vibe"" there.  I'll probably go back to staying elsewhere, upon my Vegas return."
8591,train,-1,I do not recommend this place at all. The desk manager Rajeev was a total jerk to me. First of all I book this on an application and paid in advance. When I went to check in not only did he want to see several forms of identification but then he took one credit card and swiped it and put in the wrong information and said that he needed a $150 incidental charge on a credit card for my stay. I said I pre-paid this already. He said no I need $150 hold on your credit card. I told him that's why I gave him my platinum card. He said it wasn't working. I told him I'm not gonna give you $150 cash the room was already paid for. He said well you can't have the room if I don't get a hold. And I said well then I'll just go across the way to another hotel and stay there and you can refund my room. He said if you go to that hotel room that I don't have to refund anything.  Turns out that this guy was the manager and this is a franchise so you're not gonna have any records with corporate because they don't care. I wouldn't recommend anybody stay here even if it's just for the night you're better off sleeping in the airport
2768,test,1,"My new favorite hotel in Vegas!! Loved the room, it's so worth having a balcony in Vegas. Super Clean Room, very upscale and classy!! Loved all the different options of places to dine. Gambling was fun, they even had the Classic ""War""."
2706,train,1,"My gf and I had the privilege of again staying here for her annual company trip to Vegas. We love it here! If you're looking for peace and quiet but the convenience of the strip, stay here. Yes, it's high end, but it's super calm and serene in the room.  What I loved: the staff at check-in was extremely courteous and helpful; the pools are exquisite and pretty much suit any type of pool person(private pool, lazy river, wave pool); rooms and bathrooms are huge(bed is heavenly-like); loved the evening turn-down service. There's something about water on the nightstand and the tv playing relaxing music that just erases the trouble away.  My only negatives: it takes a while to get used to the signage and secret doors that lead from the 4 Seasons to the Mandalay Bay Casino. Also, $20 for an inner tube is a bit steep.   You do get the best of both worls when you're at a hotel like the 4-Seasons, as you get the privacy especially if you wanna be with your special someone, yet still have the access of the casino and nearby casinos, clubs, etc. And surprisingly, I didn't have to Febreeze my clothes that much after returning."
342,train,1,"I recently spent a week here and loved it!  I thought we got great service, a great rate and the rooms were fantastic (especially the bed and the bathroom).  Everyone was very pleasant, helpful, and service oriented.    The resort is organized into ""villages.""  We were in Fountain Village, which I ended up thinking was the best, anyway.  We were a little farther away from the pools, but it was much more peaceful back there.  We had the option to upgrade to the kasbah pool village, but I am infinitely glad that we did not.  It was about a minute walk to the kasbah pool and less to the oasis pool.   The spa service was AWESOME...but very expensive.  I mean--the spa is massive and very nicely appointed, so I can see why the treatments need to be so expensive...but it's definitely a splurge for me.  If you go to the spa, take advantage of your all day access to the pool and other amenities...and also the dried mangoes in the waiting area.  Seriously...they are really, really good.    The restaurant was great for all meals except for dinner, but I reviewed that separately.  I think the resort would benefit from going in a different direction as far as their restaurant goes (for dinner at least).  The kasbah grill was our main choice for lunch by the pool and we had great service, food and drinks.    I would definitely go back again."

We booked a one bedroom terrace with fountain view. The view is outstanding, the room was spacious, beds and linens top notch, the staff and housekeeping were professional and personable.   The casino floor was excellent in the mornings and afternoons, good in the evenings and late night. There were too many smokers at night or else I'd say it was excellent at night.   Really enjoyed the hotel."
3230,train,1,"I really wanted to share with you the positive experience I had while traveling for business from Chicago to Las Vegas, and believe that not enough people do this, and only share negative experiences. These comments pertain the highest level of courtesy, friendliness, AND willingness to go out of front desk staff. One particular person, named Sentry, that worked the overnight shift, was extremely compassionate, and went above and beyond what she had to do to help. I had a taxi driver that , unfortunately,  uncharged me by over $20, when I fell asleep in his taxi on the way back to the hotel after dinner. I was relying on cash that I had budgeted,  until my direct deposit hit my account the following day, and I was telling her how the taxi driver was not leaving until I paid the $6 I was short on a $53 fare, that should have been $25-30 for the distance I traveled according to Sentry. So, she pulled money out of her OWN pocket and handed it to me! I was astounded, at her selflessness!       Also, every single one of the staff members each time I approached the front desk for various reasons, stopped what they were doing immediately, greeted me instantly, and AGAIN, were extremely helpful! I've honestly never experienced such kindness in all of my business and personal travel with a hotel front desk staff.       Also, I really wish that I had gotten their names,  but daytime front desk staff, a young man with blonde hair/blue eyes, and young lady also with blonde hair/darker eyes, were wonderful upon check out, and I shared my positivery experience with them, and they asked if I'd be willing to complete a survey, and of course, I accepted their request willingly. The young man went so far as to drive to my boss's office location in Henderson, where I'm training, to speak to my boss, about using Hampton Inn exclusively for future business travellers with our company, Ageless Men'sHealth, visiting  Henderson. I was in a different area of the office when he arrived with another young lady, however my boss filled me in as to the young man's conversation with him. He politely handed my boss a Hampton Inn labeled  folder that contained information  about hotel emenities, as well as information about daily brunch. What a class act! That really impressed my boss, and he ALSO couldn't believe that the young man, and young lady went out of their way to do this!     Thank you again, to everyone'should pleasant smiles I encountered daily at Hampton Inn on Astaire Drive, in Henderson. Please don't hesitate to stay here, if you're looking for a restful time, and helpful staff."
5772,train,1,"Clearly I'm the type of person who likes shiny things.  Stuff that sparkles is a big plus too.  This tower has all that and more!  On our way down The Strip my boyfriend and I decided to walk through here since it was raining.  I actually didn't even realize it was a casino because I hadn't received any offers to play here.  Well, it is a casino and the reason I wasn't notified is because it's independently owned and not part of the other clubs where I'm a member (i.e. M Life).  That didn't last very long because I'm a member now.  They had some great offers to sign up including one where they gave you $100 after you lost $100 on slots.  Coincidentally, I had just won $100 next door at Aria... and no, I didn't lose it here. I decided to make the low risk choice of providing my email address for $10 in free play.  It was a good decision because we ended up getting some decent play out of it. My only complaint (and I didn't even take a star off) was that the drink ladies never came by to offer beverages.  We weren't even in a drinking mood, but some water would have been lovely.  We even told the attendant who signed me up for their club that we wanted some water.  She said she'd send someone, but no one ever came."
9384,train,-1,"I found this place on hotels tonight for a discounted rate of $70/night. There was construction going on early in the morning, and the bathroom was dirty. Very basic and honestly, I wouldn't even pay the $70 discounted rate to stay there. Also, it's by the jail so you hear police sirens all night. They did comp $15 parking though so that's why I gave it 2 stars."
5527,train,1,"okay...so this review is just for the casino itself.  we did not stay there so i have no clue how the hotel rooms are...but i imagine them to be pretty mediocre.  haha.    the hotel itself is nothing fancy...in fact, it's a dump.  but i had the most fun gambling here than any other casino on the strip.  i'm actually sad that we waited til the last night to give this place a try.  but we made up for it by stopping by for half an hour before we had to take off to catch our flight.  we signed up for the rewards card which gave us $100 to spend on select slot machines...although i didn't win a cent...it was fun not losing my own money for once.  haha.  the tables were super fun.  it wasn't the fact that all the girls that worked there had big boobs and wore their staple hooters outfit...but it was fun watching them work it up with the older men at the tables.  i've never seen dealers get tipped so much!  they even worked it up with us which i thought was cute...i also had that urge to tip after every win.  haha.  they put on their charm 100% and it works.  i just hate going to those upscale casinos where the dealers are just as snooty as the hotel.  dealers with personalities bring that good kharma to the table...and for the most part, the dealers here lived up to that standard...until one of the dealers got a straight flush.  haha.  that should've been my hand!  well, you can't win them all...in fact, the etnire table lost...but at least we had fun!  haha.    warning:  this hotel is super smoky.  everyone and their mama's mamas were smoking...seriously, a guy sitting next to us with his mom were both smoking up chimneys.  haha.    cool hotel...awesome dealers...cheap tables...i don't think i'd ever stay the night here...but the gambling is affordable and fun!"
4436,train,1,"For only having been open 28 (or was it 25?) days, this place is pretty awesome.  This hotel is located in a muli-use high-rise in downtown Charlotte.  When my cab dropped me off here from the airport ($25 flat fare + tip, in case you were wondering), I thought he had made a mistake.   I checked the GPS on my phone to confirm we were at the right place.  A nice gentlemen at the door told me to take the first set of elevators to the lobby on the 10th floor.  The lobby is on th 10th floor?  Alright....  Reluctantly I do as I'm told and go up to the 10th floor, where I was greeted by a very nice young man in what is in fact the lobby.  I asked him about the hotel and he told me the first 5 floor are valet parking, floors 7 through 14 belong to the hotel, and floors 15 and above are privately owned condos.  Interesting, right?  He proceeded to check me in for 2 nights at a crazy low (corproate) rate.  He also let me know that thanks to my Hyatt Rewards status I had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite.  FTW!  I proceed to my room and it is indeed huge.  Way more space than I need, but I kind of like it. The room is nicely appointed, but I can't help but feel like I am in a converted office space.  Probably something about those big square colums around the room.  What are those called?  Bulkheads?  But, I digress.  I asked about room service, but I was informed that they are a ""select services"" hotel and they don't have room service.  I'm not sure which services they've selected, but so far that's the only thing I've noticed that's missing.  Not to worry though, there are a bunch of places that Yelp says deliver in the area.  I ordered dinner from Fujo Bistro (sushi) and they delivered right to my hotel room door.   They do have a complimentary breakfast in the morning though, on the same floor as the lobby (10th).   Breakfast was pretty good.  I noticed fresh fruit, oatmeal with fixings, bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches, toast, ceral, milk, coffee and juice.  My oatmeal and breakfast sandwich were quite tasty!  The bed is comfortable and the towls in the bathroom are of a decent quality (not rough, but definitely not soft).  Also the shower pressure was good (a big pet peeve of mine), and there are lots of power outlets all over the room.  They offer free wi-fi, which is nice.  They gave me the password at check-in which worked fine the first day but it didn't work the next day.  When I contacted the front desk I was informed the password changes every week.  It's not all rainbow and unicorns though.  There are a few serious drawbacks with staying here.   The first is the lack of soundproofing.  I can hear someone listening to music in the next room, and I can hear loud, albeit muffled, conversation in the hall.  I had no problem sleeping though, which was a relief.  Second, the hotel is not in a great part of town.  There are some areas I would not feel comfortable walking at night by myself within just a couple of blocks in different directions.  Finally, the building lobby (not the hotel lobby)  has two exits, but only one entrance.  I tried to get in the way I went out, and it was locked so I had to walk all the way around the building to get in.    Overall, I enjoyed my stay.  And since I didn't have to wander far for work I would definitely stay here again."
9896,train,0,"This is the 1st time that I had stayed in a non-Casino style hotel when I am in Vegas.  It was undergoing renovation when I was there in Feb '12 and that does not bother me at all as they put me in a wing that had been newly renovated that is far away from work area.   The staffs were helpful and friendly; rooms are clean but the downside it does not comes with breakfast. Come to think about it, most of the hotels on the strip does not serve breakfast as well.   The location is not far from the strip (4-5 blocks away) and it has few great restaurants within 1 sq block."
9188,train,1,"Stayed here for two nights at the end of August while my husband was interviewing for jobs.  The first person we met was originally from outside Chicago, so that was great. He drove us on a golf cart to our room, at the back of the huge property. We did valet, everything is kind of expensive so figured why not.  The room was nice, not amazing, and not worth hundred of dollars in the high season. But in August we got a great deal and the property was so quiet, we loved it. We hung out at the adults only pool (YES!) and there were only a few people there.   Had lunch at the bar area and it was ok. Has breakfast at the other restaurant, new the front of the property. Again, just ok but there's not much option to easily go off property to a Starbucks. You're pretty secluded. But that's part of what's nice.  I'd love to go here again for a staycation now that I live here, to get another good deal while the property is quiet."
4594,train,1,"The rooms are clean & the air conditioning works great! Prices are pretty good & the more you play there, the better deals you can get. I've had good & bad experiences with the counter people @ check-in & out.  There are multiple pools - all with different temperatures & a bar located by the pools.   The location is awesome. I love gambling @ MGM, but don't want to pay the prices to stay there. It's about a $10 ride to the airport.  The casino atmosphere is fuuuun. The music is great, the Craps table gets busy as soon as it opens. The roulette tables light up, which is definitely entertaining. (Play 29!) Poker area isn't the largest - usually only one table open so there are definitely better places to play that :)   Two bars - one in the front and one halfway through the casino floor.  The actual Hooters restaurant has GREAT food. Their wings are simply amazing. You can order all drumsticks if you want for like 10 cents each. The wait can be a little long, but the service is typically decent.  The Mad Onion restaurant inside is open 24 hours & they have some great deals, but the service is shotty & the wait can be FOREVER. They say they make the same wings as the restaurant, but they don't taste like them at all. The old restaurant used to be great, but since the name change & I'm assuming the new staff, it SUCKS.  Overall: good, clean, cheap place to stay."
156,train,1,"We took a road trip and stayed at a few hotels along the way, this was probably my favorite. We almost stayed downtown, but there was some convention, and we got lucky this hotel had one room left, and honored our travel coupon. Glad we ended up here, it was very nice. The front desk staff was super sweet,  the room was clean, far enough from the freeway to not hear noise, and the bed was comfy.  My favorite part was the breakfast the next morning. They offer a good free breakfast, seemed homemade, everything looked clean, and there was a waffle maker.  It didn't see like there was a lot to do around the area, it's next to a waffle house, and it's kind of far from downtown phoenix, but it's worth it to stay here. pick up a travel book at  a nearby dennys or travel center and get a coupon for it. It made it 59$ instead of the normal rate of 89$."
6736,train,0,"I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition.   Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a ""cleaning"" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.  My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.  While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ."
2289,test,-1,Worst experience ever I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or come back. If I could have selected anything less than 1 star I would of. 1 star is honestly too much to rate my visit. The hotel was dirty and old. The lack of customer service skills was unbelievable. I reserved my rooms about s month in advance as well as paid for them. I was given a check in as well as check out time. When I arrived my rooms were not ready. Check in was 4pm and my rooms were not ready till after 7pm. I was told my reservation was not a guarantee it meant they would hold my spot which made absolutely no sense because my rooms were paid for. I was accused of lying because I told them what confirmation said and asked for proof when I provided proof and they clearly saw what it said I was given no apology rather the person walked away and came back to offer me a room with 2 beds in the smoking section when I clearly requested a single king size bed in non smoking. I asked to speak to a manager and was told none were available and I would be contacted 2 days later and still no manager. I was charged 2x's for my rooms. And when we finally got to our rooms they were dirty. While waiting 3 additional hours for our rooms we went to eat a Hooters where the service was also terrible. We waited about 45 minutes for our food which came out cold. We were never offered refills. The entire experience was terrible. Really wish management would reach out yo me. I asked for a phone number to either management or corporate and was told they do not have a number to give out and they only use cell phones....Again worst experience ever
3181,train,1,"Perfect for anyone who is over the stereotypical Vegas experience (clouds of cigarette smoke, the din of slot machines, drunk bachelor/ette partiers, ill-dressed tourists, etc) - the Four Seasons is a respite from the madness of the Strip.    Stayed with my family (including a toddler and a newborn, crazy, I know) - and if we were to come back to Vegas, with or without the kids, I would insist on staying here again.  It was glorious.  We had a suite on the 39th floor, a mind boggling view of the Strip, and the incredible service that the Four Seasons brand is known for.  They had prepared a warm welcome for our kids (pint sized plush hotel robe and slippers, stuffed animals, and what totally won over our toddler's heart - M+M's and cookies on a plate decorated with his name in chocolate).  Twice daily housekeeping.  The valets greeted us by name every time we came ""home"".  They also accommodated all of our requests for various gear - additional mini fridge, DVD player - right away.  The in house restaurant - Verandah - had a great breakfast as well as happy hour.  The pool area was remarkably peaceful; if you wanted a little more activity, you had full access to the Mandalay's wave pool and lazy river.  A very different Strip experience.  Can't wait to come back."
8044,train,1,"What's not to love about this hotel?!?  The rooms are gorgeous.  The bed is super comfy and the staff is great.  The restaurant selection is awesome although everytime we come here (which is every year for my husbands birthday) we only eat at three places, Estatorio Milos (lunch), Jaleo (dinner) and The Henry (breakfast).  This place definitely deserves 5 stars.  One catch, it's pretty pricey but hey it's fantasy land right?  Why not pretend to be a trust fund baby for a weekend?  BTW, I have brought my 4 month old son and 2 small dogs here.  They were both accommodated, no worries :)  and they were very comfortable."
7218,train,1,"My new favorite hotel on the strip. The staff was excellent, from every housekeeper to front desk agent to waitresses. I have been in the hotel industry for over 25 years and I tend to be a little more critical than the average hotel guest. The Cosmo is doing everything right! We were offered a comp room based on our previous trip to Vegas and signing up for players club. I figured since it was free, we would get stuck in a mediocre room which would be fine as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. We went in with little expectations and figured our time in the actual room would be minimal anyway. We arrived prior to check in time but the agent was awesome!! I wish I remembered her name...Danellye? Anyway, she let us check in early and upgraded us to a wraparound suite on high floor. The room was absolutely breath taking. It was huge and the views were outstanding! I would stay there every time, even if I had to pay for it hahaha . Thank you Cosmo for a wonderful stay"
7932,train,1,"This hotel was bumpin. Period. The only reason for a non-5 star was upon checking in they had some issues with their computers and had to wait 45 minutes to finaly get checked in. But, they did try to mitigate the situation w/ offering complimentary cocktails and bottles of water.  Other than that, the hotel room they gave us overlooked the bellagio water show and can sit on the balcony and relax....and at night picturesque,  Can see the entire strip all the way to TI. The pools were great, check out the one sitting on top of the strip. Overall the hotel reminds me of a boutique.    Quick tip, sign up for the ""identity"" program before you go so you would may be able to get some discounts on a room.  The hotel is under the Marriott chain, so tack on your Marriott rewards # too,  If you are able to have financial backing of staying in this hotel, give it a shot."
3219,train,1,This is our go-to overnight stop when passing through Vegas! We love the spacious rooms that fit our big family. They're clean & pretty well updated. The breakfast is so yummy!! Our kids can't get enough of the swimming pool & hot chocolate!! Thank you Hampton!
1285,train,1,This place is awesome they have a back parking lot which you can use to park your car if you buy a parking package for free for 14 days so basically if you fly out of town you can leave your car here for free and they will bring you to the airport and pick you up when you come back.  The room is also very nice and modern and clean.
9904,train,0,"3.5 stars. it's off the strip, but that was okay since I was in Vegas just to eat. We drove to the strip since it's a long two blocks. The hotel staff is nice. The room is very spacious! Since it's an extended stay hotel, all kitcehnware is included like dishes, pots/pans, utensils, etc. There's a fridge, microwave, and dishwasher. Afterall, this place is really cheap! It's a great hotel for the price, that's for sure!"
700,train,1,"Was here for several nights attending a Genius Network event. Getting in late (in the dark) I thought it might be hard to find the lobby at night but it is literally just a jog to the left as soon as you turn into the main entrance. Check in was quick and efficient. When they took me to my room via a gold cart I thought it would be a long walk back to the lobby area (where the ballrooms are) but it was oddly close -- I guess the mismatch in my brain was the gold cart taking the 'road' as opposed to the walking path.  The resort itself has a wonderful feel to it. Citrus trees all over the place on the grounds, nice variety of buildings arranged in such a way that makes it feel like an old village (with modern construction) rather than a coldly laid out resort.  The ballrooms worked well for the conference and all of the service through check out was great. The lounge shuts down a little too early in my mind but the restaurant stays open a little later."
6480,train,-1,"My co workers reserved this hotel while we were here. Didn't have a good nights sleep at all. Overpriced, noisy at night, beds are not that comfortable, and not that nice for what they charge. Front desk takes forever to answer the phone. Construction noise during the day. Rooms look like what you get when you stay at a hotel in $60-70 range. Only good thing is the location to restaurants."
7075,train,-1,"I went there for an important business trip and found vomit in the hallways and the elevator bay for 2 days. The customer service and concierge service was the worst of any hotel I've ever stayed. For the cost it's definitely not worth it. Worse, I was embarrassed to have my clients there.  The gym is decent and the (super expensive) restaurants are generally good. But if you're trying to do anything besides get trashed and embarrass yourself, definitely avoid."
7719,train,1,"One image comes to mind when I think about this hotel: Miley Cyrus 2013 VMA Performance!  This place is a comical, crazy fun, madhouse! So much to see and do and hear. It's a sure win for sensory overload! Definitely not for the demour or siddity types, or those coming to Vegas for peace and quiet."
3936,train,1,"Speechless... When I say speechless, I mean there is literally nothing negative I can think of or concoct unless I do a David Copperfield & pull some BS out of thin air. Everything from start (prior & during check-in) to finish couldn't have been done any better. We're in the middle of hectic LV, yet having our own Private Entrance to the 4 Seasons, private elevators with only 5 floors (despite the 30+ floor journey), personalized service, no lines out the door at check-in & without the cigarette smoke festering in my lungs, etc..., made us feel like Royalty.   Carlos the doorman was AWESOME... So friendly, so helpful, funny & even offered a comp'd ride in their house Mercedes to grab a bite outside of the grounds (which we graciously accepted). I swear, I wish I would've taken a picture of him with my wife as we were exiting through the lobby on Day 2 while he was decked out from head to toe like Elvis. To top it all off, he even remembered my name! I could easily ramble further about how exquisite, clean, friendly, etc... this place was though the amount of content could easily fill up a small novel.  This place is absolutely amazing & should you opt to get the loud, noisy & smoke filled casino experience... Guess what? There's a private entrance up the grand staircase to get to Mandalay. Best hotel experience I've ever had..."
7258,train,1,"The hotel rooms if you get a suite are 6 stars. The service from the staff is very good, and the lobby atmosphere is very unique. Plus I appreciate that you do not walk into a room full of slot machines upon arrival."
1717,train,1,"So after calming down about the 100, overall Stay was good. Pool and hot tubs were clean but closes at 10. Pool had plenty of towels. Standard worldmark room. Didn't like that we had to dump our own garbage which are located at the ends of the place. The customer service was good overall, especially the guys at the front desk. If you need extra things like soap and garbage yu do hav to get it at the front desk. The shuttle rides saved us on taxi fees. Beds were stiff but pillows are comfy.  Didn't like the shower head no water pressure at all. I think the best part of this place is its location which is about 5 min. Away from the strip and convenient shuttle service.  Would Stay Again"
5638,train,1,This place is really nice!! We got to overlook the Bellagio fountain and see it from our terrace. The check in service was very professional and nice. It is not really recommended for kids to stay there but to go in and see the different art pieces and chandeliers is really neat. There is a secret pizza place and it took for ever to find it because they will tell you its a secret!! Well I will give you a hint their is no sign for it and its really good! Happy Hunting!! It makes the search for it that much better tasting pizza! The room is spacious and really nice. The bathroom is to die for! You get robes and slippers and every thing you need is in walking distance! Great experience the slots arn't so loosened up and the smallest blackjack buy in is $10.
7804,train,-1,"This was my second time here and I was thoroughly disappointed by the lack of cleanliness here.  There was a dirty glass, a pill in the corner of the bedroom, hair in the bathtub, chocolate sauce on the sham pillow, dirty silo cups in the dishwasher, black eyeliner scraps on the bathroom floor, an empty plastic bag by the window, and a general appearance of dirtiness on the carpets which included loose threads and crumbs.  They sent a manager up who apologized for it and admitted that it was dirty.  She gave us a $100 spa credit in addition to a $50 room credit, however, I don't really think it was worth it.  The manager was professional about the situation, however, we weren't thrilled about getting a dirty room and having to wait a long time to have it cleaned."
9664,train,1,This place is affordable and very roomy. It's about $150 a night and you get a full living room and a kitchen. I stayed here for the first time last weekend for spring break and was very impress for the stay and the price I paid for it.   It's connected to the Cosmo and plus it's on the strip. It's totally worth it and you can walk straight to the strip from here.   I would definitely refer this place to my family And friends and I'll probably be staying here from now on in Vegas.
8863,train,-1,"On the night of July 6, I stayed at the Best Western Plus Mesa. I booked the facility on Hotwire based on the positive reviews. Despite the high reviews, I was very, very disappointed in my stay.   When I arrived at 2am after a long day of traveling. The check in process took longer than it should have. The woman booked me on the fourth floor then told me she needed to change it.   In the morning, as I was getting ready in the morning, the toilet began overflowing. I called the front desk at 11am and no one answered. I called back at 11:05am, and no one answered. I called one more time around 11:10am. So, I called 1-800-WESTERN. The representative I spoke with finally got a hold of someone. By this time the entry way to the room was flooding, so I ran into the bathroom and shut off the valve.   Around 11:40am, a maintenance person came to the room without any tools. He said he would have to go find his tools. I asked him how long it would take to resolve this issue, because I had a meeting at 1pm. He shrugged and told me to ""just shower in [the sewage flooded] bathroom."" I thought he was joking, but he was not. He left. By this time, I really didn't have any options, so I laid down all the towels and took a quick shower.   The manager, Danielle, finally called the room at noon. She said she would call me back, but she never did. I got ready and went down stairs to check out. As I was talking with Danielle, the maintenance man walked by, and once he saw me he turned around. I was shocked when I was only offered 500 Best Western points for my extreme inconvenience. I am not a Best Western member, so what good is 500 points going to do?"
716,train,1,This has got to be one of the greatest experiences I have ever had at a Hotel Resort.  Outstanding service.    Those consecutive 4 diamond awards are well deserved.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE STAY HERE....
3927,train,1,"As poor college students, this was a huge splurge for my birthday, but wow. Others have said everything that needs to be said about the service. I hope to prove you don't need to be stinking rich in order to appreciate Four Seasons. Check out their internet specials for rates under four figures a weekend.  We arrived early in the morning in my boyfriend's beat up '89 Caddy, but from the way the valets treated us, we could have been driving a Maserati.   Even though we were early, check-in said our room was ready. Immediately. As in, we didn't have to wait upwards of an hour as has been my experience at every other Sin City hotel. I said it was my birthday and asked if there were any upgrades available, and we were told we'd have to wait until after normal check-in hours to find out. That was fine with us, so they held onto our luggage and we spent a few hours at the outlets.  We received a call to say our room was ready, and returned to the hotel. We ended up on the highest floor with the most spectacular view of Las Vegas I could have imagined. The room was a good size, very tastefully decorated, and the bed outrageously comfortable. The bathroom was huge, with a separate shower and bath, and the toilet in its own room. Also, as others have said, it is super quiet.  After taking a million photos of the view, we showered and went down to the pool. The Four Seasons has its own, but as a guest you also get access to those of Mandalay Bay, which has a wave pool and lazy river. We did go to the latter for a couple of hours, but the novelty wore off very quickly. The waves in the wave pool were infrequent, and the lifeguards won't let you into most of the deep end, that is, half the pool. The lazy river is cool for about three or four laps, but at lot less than that if you don't have some sort of floatation device. We bought ours from the supermarket before we left for about $20 total, which included the pump, which was still less than renting two tubes. We bumped into so many people without tubes, but I could hardly feel bad, since the lazy river doesn't give you a whole lot of control. Short story, we ended up spending a lot more time at the Four Seasons pool, where they bring you fresh towels and ice water on arrival and frozen fruit kebabs while you lounge in chairs that are always available. The cocktails at the poolside bar were pretty standard but outrageously expensive, so we only had a couple.  Oh, the pool area stays open at night, and we sneaked down one evening to take advantage of the jacuzzi tubs. Not wanting to get kicked out of the Four Seasons (and possibly arrested), we kept it clean. Honest.  We were out most of the day, but at night we arrived to a tidied room and a small birthday cake for yours truly.  Can we say, best birthday ever? Oh my yes."

I can never stay anywhere else in vegas but with you. this is a legit party hotel, the atmosphere is party rock status.the check in girl was a doll, we didnt wait too long in line i think we got there at just the right moment first off i had assumed that all the rooms had balconys so when we booked all the other rooms minus the city rooms mentioned (with balcony), so we were like whatevers,when we arrived low and behold there was a freaking balcony!! and it had a prime view of the bellagio fountains, that was such a PLUS..the room is spacious couch 2 flat scrreens a sink in the midd of the room which we turned into a freezer lol..the bathrrom was huge, spa jets in the bathtub, and really intresting wall paper for the commode, the toiletries by bigeolow were wonderful the shower gel (lavendar) divine, my friend created spa time with the shower gel and hot water in the tub to soak our weary footisies after a long night,beds super comfy, wonderfull bathrobes,spacious closets.room service super pricey as all of them are, shrimp quesadilla was good, chicken wings were not fully cooked, medium rare hamburger when well done was requested and there was no lettuce/tomaote/onioons on the hamburger, what kind of hamburger, and a dr pepper on the side $90 billl.. wtf, GO TO HOLSTEINS OR THE SECRET PIZZA PLACE reviews of those to follow.cleaning service supberb.always checking if we needed a lil spruce up.express check out by phone or tv i think  Like a dummy i forgot my phone in the room as we were already down las vegas blvd on the way to the airport,LIKE DUH came back talked to someone on the floor and right away they got a key card , and we were able to get my phone which was chillin on the unmade bed. getting my phone back quickk status is good karma for finding a phone the prev night in the cosmo bathroom and reporting it to the lost and found.. yea buddy..cosmo may be pricey but it is totally worth it..."
6930,train,1,"We did not experience the poor customer service that other reviews mention. Check in was a breeze at 4:00pm on a Friday! I was preparing myself for the worst and was pleasantly surprised.  We adjusted a few things in the mini fridge to store our food and had no problem having the charges removed. Just called the front desk.   The only downside of this trip was the lousy hot water in the shower. I know it's 100+ degrees outside, but I still need a hot shower! Didn't think to call and ask for an adjustment of the temperature.    The spa was incredible! I had the salt scrub and rose bath followed with an oil application. Amazing!   Hotel is as beautiful as everyone else described. Do not let the glamor intimidate you, just enjoy it! I will return and hope to upgrade to a suite next time."
8410,train,0,This place just opened in November 2016. I ended up here by using the Priceline Express deal. They call this a 4 star hotel. Asian themed of course with 1 restaurant. This place is just off the strip and after talking with some drivers and employees was told it is not a good idea to walk to the strip from here. The surrounding areas are a little schetchy. The rooms were amazing with very comfortable beds and the views were really nice of the hills. Casino is small and quiet .... you can almost hear a pin drop! Choices of games are extremely limited. Lucky dragon is going to have to pick it up to justify the cost of staying there off the strip.  The resort fee was rediculous for what you get. Glad I stayed...probably won't go back.
3009,train,1,"A high energy, steamy yet classy production that was well worth the ticket to make a great night out."
3128,train,1,Best hotel in Vegas for someone who is looking to relax and let go. We go to visit family routinely so my husband and I have tried most of the hotels. This one is a little removed from the strip so if you're looking to party and gamble this may not be the hotel for you. But if you want an amazing spa and a beautiful hotel this is the one you're looking for!
2592,train,-1,I hate having to cross a picket line when i check into a hotel. This hotel needs to take care of it's labor problems--don't think I'll be staying at a Wyndham again...seems like a tired old chain trying to keep up.
419,train,-1,"Worst experience...Cockroaches in the bed sheets, spiders in the shower, ants in the bathroom tub. Called to reserve cab 2 hours ahead of time, no one took care of it. Lazy and incompetent management. They gave us 2 free nights towards our next stay at the property - won't be cashing that in, no way am I staying here again even if it is for free! Take your business elsewhere, it is not valued here! Poses as a high end resort, in reality operates like a 1 star motel."
9268,test,1,"Went here yesterday evening with my boss and a couple colleagues.  Built by the founder of Bethlehem Steel, and former Federal Reserve Bank Chair Ed Burke, the location now serves as a bed and breakfast, clubhouse, and pub.    The decor is that peculiar meld between American and turn of the century continental tastes.  The furnishings recall french-styled British furnishings.  We sat in a comfortable lounge sipping wine until dinner was served.    Appetizers included polenta, calamari, biscuits, marmalade, shrimp and cheese.  I had a rib eye rubbed with an espresso based sauce, medium rare with a house Cabernet Sauvignon.  The chef is evidently self-trained, and reasonably creative judging by the osso bucco that some of my neighbours were having.  (I totally embarassed myself when I tried to explain what osso bucco was.  Fail!)  Great venue."
8029,train,1,"I can never complain about this place. Top notch service, great amenities and fantastic rooms. Probably the best on the strip here in Vegas. I usually stay in the terrace or wraparound suites, they are about as good as they come.  Get a shake at Holsteins, you will not regret it!!"
1156,train,-1,"Hatten das Hotel genommen da wir noch ein Gutschein hatten zum GlÃ¼ck. Als wir ankamen und zu Mittag essen wollten, waren die Tische noch dreckig von den GÃ¤sten davor.  Aus den LÃ¼ftungsschlitzen ist der Staub schon heraus gefallen.  Es ging weiter im Hotelzimmer. Haare im Bad, MÃ¼lleimer noch voll Matrazen waren schon durch gelegen, FuÃboden war auch nich grÃ¼ndlich gesaugt etc    Die Freundlichkeit an der Rezeption lies auch zu wÃ¼nschen Ã¼brig. Der Shuttle Service hingegen war in Ordnung    Das einzig positive war wenigstens das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck morgens, dies war Gesund und lecker sowie reichlich."
3775,train,0,"Booked at this hotel due to its proximity to the strip and for the price at the time it seemed fair, the photos of the hotel and casino overall looked great... Fast forward to our arrival at the hotel room  march 26 2015 and it was like ridiculous!!! No offense to Motel 6, but the room looked like one of their simple rooms! I give this 3 stars because the staff, house keeping service was good and the pool area was nice. For $160 something a night I expected way better. The room had stains on the carpet, my bed sheet had stains, there was still someone else's hair on the shower wall and large dust bunny in the bathroom, cracked sink and torn shower curtain that was way too short for the tub. Rusted door hinges on the bathroom probably because there is no venting system to pull out the steam. The ac is an old wall ac that was too loud I thought I would break at any time. The furniture was scraped up and we had a nice view to the pool but it was obstructed by the filth on the windows. Here are the few good things: always good parking, fast elevators, friendly staff and housekeeping, Keurig coffee maker and bottled waters in the room and nice pool facilities. For the price I would not stay here again unless all these things were fixed and the rooms were better quality."
2620,train,1,"A+++ My friends & I were spoiled at the pool! Every 10-15 mins we were offered frozen fruit, Evian mist, etc. The suite was very spacious & the view was beyond gorgeous! Restaurant food was great and so was the wine we had."
6254,train,1,"If you can afford it you can buy it.... Don't come to this hotel expecting to get anything cheap. In fact, dont come to this hotel expecting anything to be reasonably priced. It's not, low end blackjack tables are $25 a hand, a cocktail is $16, entrance to Marquee on a Saturday is $70. But, if you come here with the idea that money is no boundary, then whatever you want is yours. Cabana with its own private jacuzzi overlooking the pool party? Yes please. Buzzing nightclub until 5am? OK. Friendly waitresses and dealers? Sounds good. Buffet with everything from sushi to roast beef? Great.  verall, the Cosmopolitan was an amazing experience The rooms were just fantastic, the pools were unbeliervable, the music at the tables was awesome and the clubs you could really tear it up in.  Whatever you do, get a players card, you are probably going to spend enough to get something comp'd!!"
5104,train,-1,"The room is what you would expect for the price.  We stayed in a King size, non-smoking room in the Bay View on the third floor.  The room was clean and spacious.  We had view of the pool out the sliding glass door and realized that the sliding door could open if unlocked.  Not sure if that was meant to be opened, I'm pretty sure it could be a safety issue, even though it was only the 3rd floor.  But back to the room...The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really soft. The was a Keurig Machine with 2 K-Cups, full-size ironing board, plenty of towels, a blow dryer. My biggest complaint was about the 1.5 inch gap underneath the door that separated the our room from the next.  You can see light peering underneath and you can absolutely HEAR EVERYTHING that the people in the next room were doing.  There must have been about 4 people in that room and they were having some kind of wresting matches and listening to loud music. In most Hotels, the sound would have been muffled or absorbed...but not this room.  I'm pretty sure if I would have peeked underneath the door, I would've been able to see what was going on.  I threw the extra blanket on the floor, for my own privacy, but it did nothing for the sound.   There is supposed to be $1 Blackjack here, but there are only like 2 tables.  Most of the people that work here are friendly and look like they want to be there.  One issue with Valet was when we came back on early Sunday morning, around 12:30 a.m., they told us they didn't have any parking spots available for our van....what? Why do we even pay resort fees for? There was absolutely no parking anywhere, and after seeing how annoyed I was, they quickly found a solution to leave it parked outside near the Hooters truck.    Overall, the hotel is decent for the price. It's clean and the beds are comfy. One more thing...this place does not have a cancellation policy. You basically lose your money if you can't stay on the night you reserved.  You cannot change your date, you cannot get a refund. This is probably the main reason I will not stay here again.  They were not very accommodating in that area."
6114,train,0,The place is beautiful design. No problem there - the room is very nice ( not really clean well or maintenance ) concierge was below expetections - after chekin I talk to them about my wife bday and here first time in Las Vegas they afford mediocre info I can google no help in getting tickets on our last day they now tell there was special vacation menus - to late buddy. Not really sure I can recommend it - bit standing at concierge desk did notice of you light skin you were Dresden whit care and acutely helpful - Im a born and race here and I'm litle tan distressing being judge on looks after spending my money at this oocarion.
4890,train,1,"Finally, something different from what I'm used to! I've been visiting Las Vegas since the 90's (the days when LV catered to children with wet 'n' wild water park, almost every casino had arcades and amusement parks) and I have lived here long enough to not wander the Strip unless friends or family are in town. The Cosmopolitan just may change that.   DECOR: From the outside, she makes you wonder ""What's in there?"" and once you make your way to the parking/ Valet area, you're kind of distracted with all the details that the other casinos lack in the parking garage. Lights, crystals,... Not such a good idea for dumb drivers as we experienced... WATCH THE ROAD DUMMY.   After speaking to one of the employees, the rumors are true, the valet parking area is like that of the one that you'd find if you google the word's ""Volkswagen parking garage"", robotic platforms and compact spaces. With a 4"" clearance on the top, bottom and sides, oooweee, you better bet that those Valet employees are trained! The person I spoke to said that their Valet can accommodate up to 1,400+ cars, so to not turn any guest away. Holler.   The self parking garage, as you can see from some of the photos, each floor painted with a different theme. We took our time looking for a parking spot because 1. we wanted to checkout the wall art, and 2. It was so damn busy since they just had their Grand Opening the day prior and people just did not know how to drive, le sigh.   There's a huge chandelier that covers 3 or 4 floors of the center bar. Random areas of unique chairs, sofas and a pool table in the center of the third (?) floor. Restaurants and mall areas have many unique pieces of art, decor and things that you just have not ever been able to see at any other casino.   GAMBLER'S POINT OF VIEW: I did not see a sports book. Weird... or just enjoyed a few too many cocktails and didn't notice, LOL.   I am not much of a gambler, $20 and I am done, but I had to give this place a try. Towards the front of the casino, they have themed gambling areas. Dealers are dressed different from pit to pit (some burlesque type outfits, some, collared shirts) even the bars are decorated different from one another.   Although you'll never see me wait hours on end to enter a nightclub, I'd like to check it out... Promoters, where you at??   I'd love to check out the rooms and pool, perhaps a summer staycation :)"
7955,test,-1,"Pros: Really amazing to look at, awesome restaurants, younger crowd. Some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Definately the best brunch buffet in Vegas at the Wicked Spoon.  Cons: THE STAFF. I put in all caps because they are just that bad. Wanted a romantic weekend in Vegas with my boyfriend, so I booked a suite with a king bed. When we got there, we were told there were no clean rooms with king beds. I said we would wait. The woman checking us in then replied in a very snotty, stuck up way ""King bed is an option, its not guaranteed. All we have are rooms with two queens."" I asked if I could pay the upgrade and get a 1 bedroom suite. She said there were none of those with king beds either. Aparently there were no available rooms in the entire 60 floor hotel with a king bed.  Now, I don't know about you, but rooms with two queen beds remind me of family road trips, the least sexy thing I can think of. For what I paid for the room, I would think they could at least send a staff member to clean a room with a king bed for us.   They did give us a $50 food credit, but in this hotel that won't even cover a good steak and a cocktail. I wouldn't have minded as much if I felt like the woman checking us in had tried even a little bit to accomodate me, but she was just terrible, acting like I was inconveniencing her.  Also, if you expect the waitresses in the bars to serve you, you'd better be prepared to start flashing your cash, because they completely ignored us while there were 3 of them serving a party of 5 nearby, who must have been tipping large or something.  Now I move onto the Marquis Nightclub - There was barf in the line that no one cleaned up throughout the entire hour we were waiting. Gross.  The line made me excited for the club because there were a lot of glamorous young people waiting. However, when we got to the front, we saw we had been waiting because they kept letting in huge groups of fat, poorly dressed bald men. Seriously they were wearing sweatshirts and old loafers, not even attempting to dress up. Obvoiusly not rich or anything. Later we learned that there was some kind of video game convention in town that they were catering to, but still, on the main floor the ratio had to be at least 5 to 1 fat bald men to hot girls. The boombox was much better ratio wise, but not nearly as cool as the main room as far as decor.   Moral of the story: 1. If you want a sexy grown up king-bed room, don't count on one here. 2. If you want the waitresses in the bars to serve you, start flashing your benjamins. 3. If you want to go to a club that is not full of ugly fat men, make sure there is not a video game convention in town."
5798,test,1,"I expected a little more in regards to customer service. I had booked the City Room with no terrace from a 3rd party website. It was supposed to come with a gift card not resort credit, well I didn't receive it at check in and called down to the front desk and they said they'd ""take care of it, just come down to the small desk on the side when you come down to the lobby."" I asked if I could come down anytime, and she told me yes. Well I went down around 11pm and they had told me that they don't take care of it and told me to come back when the Concierge's office was open. I went back the next day after lunch and they told me that the front desk is in charge of it. After having waited in a few lines and wasting my gambling time in line, I was pretty irritated. The casino manager came out to take care of things himself and resolved the issue and gave his sincerest apology, I accepted.  The room's mini bar had things covered in a nice layer of dust which was just visually gross. The clock is pretty freeking cool! It controls the room lights and tv volume I think it was. I loved the peep show glass for the shower, hilarious how the blinds are controlled from outside the shower.   I was basically able to stay inside Cosmo all day and night and not get bored. It's pretty much a small city. I got a good deal on the room again so I will be going again soon. This time I booked directly through the hotel."
6176,train,1,Great spot on the Vegas strip.  Rooms are very well appointed with full living room and kitchen for entertaining.  Nice pools with a more low key relaxed vibe.  If you plan your trips around nightlife it was a huge bonus to save the $40 cover per person by showing the staff your room key for complimentary cover.
5966,train,1,"Okay, I'm a Vegas junkie, and have stayed at quite a few properties on The Strip over the years, but The Cosmo is, by far, my favorite!  I just adore the decor!  It's sexy, sleek, and a bit playful.  Modern, but plush.  Naughty, but nice. The rooms are fabulous, and it's the only hotel on The Strip with actual balconies (so The Hangover is no longer accurate! Ha!).  There is a phenomenal selection of restaurants and bars (Milos is not to miss, and their 24 hour restaurant, The Henry, is fantastic...shortrib eggs Benedict with caviar, need I say more?).  I really appreciate The Cosmo as a wheelchair user - unlike most other popular hotels on The Strip, the entrance to the casino is literally right on the sidewalk...you don't have to travel up a long driveway/entranceway to get to the front door.  Once you enter, it's a straight walk through the casino (on non-carpeted flooring) to get to the room elevators.  Additionally, The Cosmo doesn't have a huge crowd drawer (such as a conservatory, dancing fountains, talking Greek gods, a shopping mall or a resident show of painted acrobats) to create extra chaos for those of us navigating through the casino in a chair, which is a nice change after dodging tourists, Elvis impersonators and people handing out call girl flyers all day.  I really love that their bathroom goodies (shampoo, bath gel, etc) are C.G. Bigalow - and they have a pretty full collection of Bigalow products in their gift shop, including their famous and fabulous lip glosses and balms, which I am addicted to.  The rooms are great and very accessible - however, my ONE complaint is about the bathroom.  The tile in the bathroom is not slip-resistant.  Kind of silly.  Even if the floor is totally dry, you could easily slide around just wearing socks, which my mom did several times.  Once it is wet, it's a disaster waiting to happen.  Particularly for people with mobility challenges who are able to walk/stand, you need to be extra cautious.  I've yet to try Wicked Spoon, but I've heard it's a fantastic buffet (even from folks who aren't the biggest buffet fans, which I am not), and hope to go when I visit next time."

If you're a high roller stay in NE corner wraparound terrace suite request 29th flr or higher. $500night minimum but big enough to throw quite a party overlooking the strip.

6308,train,1,"Originally I was annoyed that the Cosmopolitan agreed to step up their game and did not. However the Operations Manager reached out to me to make things right. I truly respect that they did and am grateful to be an Identity Member. They have credited my nights back and promised nothing but the best service for my future stays. Hoping third time's the charm!!!  Original post: To make a long story short, I just had a phone call with Chance the Front Desk Manager who told me that maintenance and all hotel employees are allowed to enter my room unless I have a do not disturb sign on the front door. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan from 4/15-4/17 for a conference. Chance assured me upon arriving that my experience would be better than last time when someone at the front desk accused me of charging thousands of dollars to my room when I did not and led to the company not booking me again due to the way the Cosmopolitan handled the situation. I was apprehensive about visiting again, however was initially put at ease by Chance. Half an hour into my stay Chance asked when maintenance could come by, I told him tomorrow morning, and 2 maintenance guys walked into my room without so much as knocking. I could have been naked and moving forward didn't feel safe. When I called Chance he told me to put the do not disturb sign on my door. Today he told me anyone from the hotel has a right to walk in unless it's on the door."
2721,train,1,"As borat sagdiyev would say, ""waawaweeewa!!"". Or ""king in da castle, king in da castle!"".  Had the wonderful opportunity to stay here in a terrace suite on the 46th floor overlooking the stip/bellagio fountains.  Well what can I say,   I'll start with PARKING.   5 stars.  The garage is laid out very well and you are only a short walk to the elevator. This can be quite convenient when going back and fourth from room to car. Also, all of the spots have a really great LED system that is set up above the parking spot that lights up green when empty, and stays red when occupied. Thus making finding a spot MUCH MUCH EASIER!!!  SERVICE: 5 stars  From the check in desk, to the prompt security this place has their service ON POINT!!! I had an inncedent on my first night with a loud neighbor at 5:00 am. I called the desk, noise was gone under 5 minutes. End result, a happy customer.  Hotel/casino. Do I even have to say??  Of course it's 5 stars...  ....It's a 4+ BILLION DOLLAR HOTEL!!!  Apparantly the whole ""city center project"" including vdara, mandarin oriental, veer towers, aria, as well as the cosmo and the defunct harmon, was IN TOTAl, 9 billion! before ressecion and inflation.   Thus making the cosmopolitan absorb almost HALF the cost of the whole freakin place.  Uhh, ya... It's pretty effing nice. Probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in and seen.  Final word. Stay here. If Vegas is a special treat for you, then what better way to spen your time here than in one of the most expensive hotels in the world?"
7467,test,0,"I am unsure how I feel about this establishment, because it kind of reminds me how I feel about going to Town Square and all of the nightclubs in this town, which I avoid like the plague, so for now I am giving them just a middle of the road review.    Everything, including the employees looks way too pretty and the clientele seem to be extra douchey because of it.  It was obvious to me from looking around there for a few seconds that the Cosmopolitan overall values outward appearance over personal, inner character.    I will be coming here if I'm on the strip for the secret pizza, because it is some of  the best I have ever had, but the policy of only hiring eye candy in the casino itself doesn't sit well with me.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and nothing here is my idea of beautiful.  A great place hires people of all shapes and sizes, a strong work ethic, and a good heart.  I really did not see the heart in this casino, except in the pizza restaurant, where it is obvious a lot of love goes into those heavenly pies.  We'll see as time goes by and I visit here a few more times if I've changed my tune about my initial opinion."
6342,test,1,"I'm left speechless.   I wanted a VIP weekend for a very special occasion, and that's exactly what the fine folks at the Cosmopolitan delivered - and more.  If you are looking for a hotel that delivers the glitz and youthful glam of Vegas coupled with impressive VIP service, the Cosmopolitan is an excellent choice. I had reserved a two bedroom suite (not on the website, you have to call reservations to inquire) for a small private party I wanted to host.  Prior to my arrival All my reception catering questions were answered promptly (the same business day).  Days before my trip, I received a courtesy phone call to see if there was anything I needed for my trip to their property.   Upon arrival  Check-in was fast. Even better they upgraded me to a Bungalow suite - since there was some availability. Wow. Can you say beautifully appointed, 3-story (2,400 sq ft) suite, with private jacuzzi on the roof, overlooking the Marquis on one side and with a view of the Bellagio fountains on the other side? Ridiculous.  From there it just got better, the champagne that my co-workers sent ahead of time, was chilled and waiting in the room for us. The hotel figured out I like tequila and had a complimentary bottle of Patron waiting in the room. When they learned my preference was Don Julio 1942, they swapped out the Patron without batting an eyelash. (no, I didn't scoff at the Patron.)  Their butler service was on point and attentive the entire weekend.   Catering was 100x better than I expected. I was reluctant to have them cater the party at first, especially since there are so many awesome restaurants in LV. But I was plesantly surprised. Blame it on the al-al-alcohol?! I think not. My friends came up to me to tell me how much they enjoyed the food too.   Room audio hook ups BUMP-IN! I just docked my iphone, turned on the spotify and we were good to go.  Casino Beautifully decorated, amazing complimentary cocktails if you're playing, and friendly dealers.   I've never done Vegas like this. It was pricey to be sure. But for me, it was a once in a lifetime kind of party, and it was worth every penny!  Big thanks to the entire VIP services team (especially Bill and Marcus), for making that weekend one that I'll never forget."
9044,train,1,Friendly and helpful staff welcomed us for our stay.   The room was large and comfortable.    Typical continental breakfast with eggs and sausages added.    Well priced
8619,train,1,"Only one complaint, it's hard to find the entrance! We drove right by even though the GPS told us to turn. The area is still under construction so it''s a bit weird to find. The room was nice and clean. This is a pet friendly location and we had our Bernese Mountain Dog (about 90 pounds) with us. The dog was a non-issue. She was welcomed as were we. There are a few areas outside for walking the dog, but really, just some parking lot medians not a dog friendly area. It was adequate though. They even provided a free poop bag dispenser, for obvious reasons. When they cleaned the room, they even vacuumed the dog's bed. Nice touch. Traveling with pets or not, this is a good location. Free WiFi for Hilton Honors members. Gym and pool as well. Free American buffet breakfast, albeit all pre-made."
2355,train,-1,Ok hotel but water shut off when I was all soaped up in the shower. There was no warning and/or alert that the water would be shut off.   My wife called the front desk and they up 2 bottles of water so I could rinse my body and crack off.  I complained at the front desk and told that there were fliers left under the door of my room. There wasn't anything in my room. All they could say was sorry. Bad attitude. Seemed like they didn't care one bit.  Don't stay here. Spend a few extra $ and stay a hotel that can deliver an excellent stay.
5796,train,1,"I've had great stats at cosmopolitan in the past few months and I always enjoy the hospitality.  This particular visit was a bit different as it took half an hour for the housekeeping to pick up the phone to have our room serviced,and upon check in another guest same name, is checking in at the same time on my reservation how does that happen. Well the staff at cosmopolitan hoped on the situation at once and got it handled. I was more than happy with that as easily someone could've gotten away with some identity theft and my reservation.  Other than having to wait for house keeping I have no complaints about my stay at the cosmopolitan it was a great time as usual."
8920,train,0,"Given the recent large cashball bonuses at BS ( BOulder Station ) bingo, the gf and I have made several trips to BS the last several weeks.  Probably 2nd lowest rated of the station casinos ( I can't stand Palace Station !! ) but it's still worthy of an occasional trip.  Gaming - the aforementioned Bingo is average at best - small area for non-smokers that is of little value given the crappy ventilation.  Free drinks ain't the best - only beer options are bud and bud light.  They have a ton of gaming machines to choose from.  A large number of table games.  given my focus on craps - i like the 10x odds but not happy with the ""modified"" fire bet ( a home run gives you 300-1 on the fire .)  Also, frustrated by the fact that virtually every visit involved trainee dealers.  The drink ladies frequently make the rounds - big plus !  They have a large poker room that is very active.  Bad Beat jackpots appear to drive the level of activity.  Food - working class restaurants.  we've only tried the burger king and subway.  Surprised we haven't hit the buffet.  I suspect the buffet will be average at best but again, i've yet to try.  They have a steakhouse which the gaming hosts have offered a comp - i'm sure one day we'll try.  Bars - they have a decent number of bars but i've only had one drink at a bar.  Surprised at the quizical response when i asked for a blue moon - am i speaking greek ??  Entertainment - I have no idea !  I believe they have a movie theatre but i'm not 100% sure.  Parking - tons of parking surrounding the casino.  Rooms - again no idea and no future plans for a staycation.  Overall, I'm a little surprised at how busy BS is - I get a better vibe at the local competition - Sam's Town and Eastside Cannery."

8006,train,1,"This is the first time that I checked in the Cosmolitan. The location was along the strip thus its accessible to all the establishments by the Vegas strip. If you're hungry, you can just cross the bridge from the hotel and you can find a variety of restaurants that you can choose from. The big surprise during our stay was our room because the room was so spacious and beautiful! I think it's a mini suite. There's a jacuzzi and separate shower room. There's a small living room which has its own TV and the bed is king size and very comfortable and also have another TV. I was also greatly impressed of their lobby. The chandeliers are pretty that it makes the lobby sparkle. They have interesting and fun artwork (such as the big stiletto). I also like that the casino area doesn't smell cigarette smoke unlike the other casino hotels. The parking garage has plenty of spaces thus it's not hard to find a parking even on weekends. The staff were also very accommodating. I would definitely come back to this hotel again and enjoy their perks as a member."
292,train,1,Stayed here for a weekend to attend a football game at the nearby Cardinals Stadium.  Hotel staff was very friendly and were over-the-top helpful with any questions we had about the area.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the sports complex area of Glendale.
4361,train,1,"Looks: Extremely nice.  My wife and I go to Vegas 3 times a year, we have stayed at every hotel on the strip and Cosmo is by far the nicest we have stayed at. We got a special suite that has an out door balcony that wrapped around our hotel room, it had 3 sliding doors, that's how long it was. 2 full bathrooms, 2 large LED TV's and a kitchen.  The casino is very nice, it is very modern and definitely appeals to a younger, more hip crowd. At night there is a club pool side, although this sounds nice, it can be tough to sleep with the music pounding outside your window. Service: Practically impossible to get a drink. The waitress came around maybe once every 50 minutes.  I spent a lot of money gambling, I should get drinks faster then that. Food: There many many places to eat, pretty expensive and you get the feel of it as soon as you walk in the casino. Everything just feel more expensive, kind of of like the Bellegio and The Wynn.    Overall, I really enjoyed the place. We got a special promotion of $300 free slot play and $275 free food, don't know how much less I would of liked the stay there if I was actually paying for it? But It was very nice and it feels good sometimes to relax in a place way out of your normal life.  A very high class modern casino/hotel that plays dancing music all through the night. I would stay there again if they gave me the same free promotion, otherwise, I probably cannot afford it.  And, no sports book! What's up with that?"
7615,train,-1,"NOT FOR GAMBLERS.  Several of us, including myself, took out decent sized markers ($5-$10K) and played BJ and craps for literally 12 hours a day for three days -- but they refused to comp us even a $35 buffet.  Anyone who gambles knows that this like being refused a bottle of water.  It was so surprising and insulting that I didn't even know how to react.  We stayed Fri-Sun 11/6-11/9 in room 2953, a 2-bedroom city suite, which was nice, but nothing spectacular.  Not coming back."

8400,train,-1,"By far, one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. Booked a room through Priceline weeks in advance and was planning on staying here on our way to Utah. Left our house late and couldn't wait for a good nights rest. After driving for 5 hours we finally arrived only to be told that they gave away our room to somebody else. Even after we had already paid for it!! Then they had the nerve to tell us they couldn't give us another room AND they couldn't refund us!! Are you kidding me?!?! Left us on our own to find another hotel at 2AM. Will never go back to this place again!"

Sweet man! Sitting rooms, eating rooms, stairways.... All completely restored to the 1800s. We munched on the fresh homemade chocolate chip cookies, popcorn, pretzels and nuts to crack that were sit out for guests in the dinning room (we arrived after dinner time). Our rooms were lovely! Included all animities. For breakfast there was fruit, pastries, cereal, juice, yogurt and the ability to make waffles. All complimentary. Talking with Jeff was great, he was so personable and friendly. The house was beautiful! So much more enjoyable than staying in a Hilton or a Hyatt- such a grander adventure."

The room is larger than aloft, well appointed, and with that nice modern open feeling and design.  Lots of exposed concrete used very effectively.  Room was well appointed, you could even do a little cooking if you wanted to.  Bed was very comfortable, room was quiet at night - great sleep.  The lobby bar is well-stocked and their happy hour is decent.  We had fun talking with the psych-major bartender.  He gave some good recommendations for eats nearby.  We asked for a bit of a late checkout and they were very easy about it.  There is some free covered parking... excellent bonus.  I would gladly go back next time I happen to be in Madison."
3896,train,1,"Stayed at the Wyndham Grand downtown this weekend, 7/20-22 and was very pleasantly surprised by the service and condition of the room.  The past reviews sum things up nicely, as location is the best feature here.  Everything downtown is in walking distance (PPG Place, theaters, PNC Park, Rivers Casino, Warhol Museum) and everything else is a short drive.    Valet parking was $28 and well worth every penny.  it's a consequence of where the hotel is located, and I believe the Wyndham leases the parking spaces from the city.  So essentially, you're paying $8 more per night to not have to walk to your car.  The view of the incline and the three rivers/Point State Park was great and the room was nice and clean.  A little on the small side, but that doesn't bother me one bit, I'm not trying to stretch out in my room for a few days.  Check in/out was a breeze.  I highly suggest you book this place if you find a great deal."

7654,train,1,"this is as good as it gets in vegas, baby. it's a brand-spanking new, stiletto'ed glam-fab casino on the strip. it's the jimmy choo of casinos if they were shoes.  Key Points 1. service is pretty flawless. it's almost like being waited on by management consultants because they are constantly coming up with solutions to best serve you or answer a question. not the usual robotic, yes/no responses. oh and when you hit ""beck and call"" on the phone, a smart, polite, amicable person picks up within 1 ring.  2. the restaurants on the 3rd floor are all super expensive. all of them. i mean like $36/dish expensive. but pretty stunning selection.  3. billing and estimation is HORRENDOUS. although I booked through ""a third party"" (priceline) i got 4 or 5 different interpretations of my bill.  some people said there would be 12% on top, others said not. we got so many mini bar charges that were reversed. i'm pretty sure they do that just to smoke & mirror you. oh and it's been a week since i got back and i STILL haven't gotten the bill emailed to me.   4. Location could be better. a couple ppl commented that it's not as central as Bellagio and Caesar's.  5. Decor is gorgeous. It's more of a fashion experiment in art-deco, glam, accessory-mania, glitterati kaleidescop-ism. an oasis from the disney-themed or italian/roman-themed casinos LV is beating the crap out of.  6. i have to comment on the music in the elevator, downstairs lobby, and Holsteins. whoever chose that music is my lover. and my savior amidst the mind-numbing euro-trash club techno. DEPECHE MODE? JUNIOR BOYS? SPOON? NEW ORDER? i wanted to curl up in that psychedelic elevator the whole trip and be mind-massaged by all the music i love. CALL ME. WE WILL MAKE BEAUTIFUL MUSICAL BABIES TOGETHER. WE WERE MEANT TO BE.  7. Marquee:Clubs as Jupiter:Planets  ciao"

I don't know if it's the music at the pool or the good looking people but you kind of get a buzz as soon as you enter. I love the design of the hotel. It feels like you have been transported to an exotic country. The rooms are spacious & clean. I would give the montelucia 5 stars if they had consistently great service. I will continue to come here & make it my spot to get away from reality for a day."

Additional for tennis court usage.  Free Wifi. No tub in room. Just a shower stall.  Cool wallpaper. It's coming back I suppose.  $200/night on weekends."
7803,train,1,"Enjoyed my girls weekend trip. Second time coming here but first time actually staying here. First impression of the hotel is that it is for the young at heart. If you're planning to stay here for a family vacation, you're better staying at another hotel. Lots of young folks everywhere so if you don't want to hear music blaring at all hours of the day throughout the hotel or don't want the little ones to see women in their 6-inch heels, boobs hanging out, or asses hanging out- you're better off at Excalibur or Circus Circus.  Anyhow, the rooms are very modern. There's a big balcony, gorgeous tiled shower, big jet bathtub, & spacious two sink counter--& with five girls staying together we were very comfortable. Aside from the mini bar & mini frig, there was also a microwave & dishwasher. Although we didn't use the dishwasher, the microwave did come in handy.  I also enjoyed my time at the 4th floor pool. Back & forth chillin on the patio chairs & in the pool, drinking my frozen alcoholic drink while enjoying the Las Vegas sun. Beware of ordering food however, it takes forever! So either eat before you come to the pool or be very patient.  Don't forget to stop by the big chandelier to take pictures--I don't know how many pictures we took. There's also a bar so just chill there while waiting for Club Marquee to open.  Every genre of music at Club Marquee. No one will feel left out! There are also lots of tables & cabanas for bottle service. It gets packed quick so girls beware of wearing those 6 inch spikes-the only time you get to sit down is if you have a table to crash at.  Don't forget to eat at the buffet called The Wicked Spoon. Ate there for brunch and I really enjoyed my made to order omelet and my ready to build lox bagel.   There are also other restaurants throughout the hotel. However, don't forget to eat at Holsteins. It's a pretty good burger joint. Milkshakes for the kids and you can also add alcohol for the adults. Not too hungry for an 8 or 16 ounce burger? No problem, they also serve tiny burgers which is a great little snack before the club. They come in three's so it's always good to share.   Overall my experience at The Cosmopolitan was a pleasant one. Heard the customer service isn't that great but luckily I didn't experience any of that this past weekend. On my next Vegas getaway I will consider staying here again."
8063,test,-1,"This place is waaaaaaay overrated!  I agree with the person who was talking about the wet carpets!  We got off our elevator and saw disgusting brown wet spots on the carpet WTF?  And it smelled funny!    We got to our room, the woman at the desk really hyped up the room saying oh you're getting one of our most requested rooms that have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  We open the door to our room and my friend instantly said it smells like a skunk in here!  And I agree it had this faint smell of a skunk or musty smell in the room.  Excited to see the view of the fountains we open the curtains to find a window so dirty on the outside you couldn't see any fountains!  I've NEVER been to a hotel with windows so dirty you cannot even see out of them!  Overall the room wasn't that clean for what we were paying.  The lighting sucked.  the bathroom light didn't work, the ceiling light bulbs were going in and out in the main area of the room.  It's kind of a more girly hotel, so to have such poor lighting in the room is very disappointing!  Also, when they cleaned our room, they actually took soap and 2 other items they provided the first day off the shelf which I definitely thought was strange, usually they give you more the next day.  I'm only giving this place 2 starts because at least the sheets were clean and the casino itself was beautiful with all the chandeliers.  But honestly it only deserves 1.5 stars, you should never have dirty windows or a smelly room.  Won't be staying here again!"

The casino floor consists of table games, maybe 15 and a few slots... compared to any other casino that house hundreds. There were a handful of people there and it just felt weird being there. A group of security guards were standing in the center of a walk way talking and giggling and didn't to move out of guests way. We were going to eat at the Asian restaurant but there as no one eating and no employee up front. We left and spent a total of 5 minutes here. They need more dynamic, more gaming and maybe music?"
8659,train,-1,"First of all don't believe the photo they put in booking.com because they actually took a picture of their sign in front of encore hotel, that's just wrong. Although we checked out of the hotel after 30 mins of staying there I can say that the rooms were not clean! Carpets were not clean, the beds were not clean, the kitchen was not clean too. The hotels in the strip are also doesn't cost that much instead of staying in this hotel you can stay in a hotel in the strip and have a casino in your ground floor. Customer service wasn't bad they fully refunded our check. Also the rooms look really old."
9511,train,1,"Came into town for a wedding, had a great pre-negotiated event rate (140.00 + taxes I think?).  Immediate impressions were that the staff was as friendly, accommodating, and as eager to please as any hotel staff I've ever encountered, and that's saying a lot.  Needed extra pillows, late checkout, and 10 pages printed at front desk for business deal.  Check, check, and check.  All with a smile and no prob attitude.  Rooms were excellent, completely updated with flat screens; nice bathrooms, lots of marble and great water pressure.  Room was plenty large, not sure if we had an upgrade....  Breakfast was included, pretty standard hot/cold buffet but they did have an omelet station so that was a step up in class as well.    My only negative was that it's a very busy hotel (at least during the weekends) and the lobby is cavernous and could easily seat 100 people or so, but it's a mashup of mismatched chairs, settees, sofas.  There's not nearly enough seating for a lobby this size; it could easily seat 100 people or so.  On a better note, the staff is GREAT, the lobby bar is ok also, and the location is virtually unmatched.  You can walk to the football stadium and the downtown core. The Marriot at Key Center is a nice place."
1100,train,-1,"Rooms are great. Valets are great. Bussers are amazing. What the actual fuck is up with every wait staff? Service is terrible; slow, forget things *repeatedly*, don't come back to see if you need anything or if they screwed up your order. , No showing up for coffee, water, refills. Our waitress disappeared for a bit more than a half hour last night. I'm guessing, from where she eventually came from she was smoking a spliff. Three days in a row, terrible. Donald Trump bad. This is a Marriott. What the crap?"
1258,train,1,"I recently stayed overnight in the Ellersly House Hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, friendly, clean hotel with exquisite food. I paid Â£69.99 as part of an offer. This was for an overnight stay for 2 people, a 3 course evening meal, a bottle of prosecco and box of chocolates in the room on arrival and breakfast the following morning. Therefore, I couldn't tell you the individual price this would normally have been; however the hotel did not scrimp on anything being as it was part of a deal. The room was lovely and clean. Not the largest of room, but alright for an overnight. The staff were very accommodating and informed us when the best time would be to eat (as there was a large group booking in). The dinner was very tasty and beautifully presented. we had the smoked salmon, and pate for starters. Main courses were steak, and I had the chicken stuffed with haggis on a bed of mustard mash.  The desserts were gorgeous. Cheesecake with an array of berries around it, and the other dessert was a toffee bomb (ice cream with toffee sauce).  Breakfast was a buffet between 8am and 10am  fry ups, cereal and chocolate croissants etc. The hotel had a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The only point worth noting  you are situated along the north bypass entry into Edinburgh at a location where there isn't much within walking distance; however the nearest bus stop is all but five minutes away. Nice location if you just fancy a quiet stroll. There is private parking in the grounds of the hotel too which is handy. Thanks to all the staff for making this a very pleasant stay."
4061,train,-1,"When you think of Las Vegas, you think of bigger and over-the-top, but prepare yourself for disappointment upon entering the Hooters Restaurant in the Hooters Casino.  To put it best: it's an ordinary Hooters restaurant that happens to be in Vegas, as opposed to being the ""Vegas Hooters.""  Expect your typical Hooters experience but in a drearier setting because the Hooters Casino is a bit dingy, and with so many other places to visit for cheap greasy food this place is usually very quiet.  In my opinion, Hooters should consider putting more money into the location and making it a Vegas destination.  There are other places with better looking waitresses and cheap food/drinks, so why limit one's self to this hole in the wall location?  In Vegas, there are too many options for attractive waitresses to be stuck at this place - that's the feeling that I got during my visits.  There is nothing wrong with the place and it is your typical Hooters experience, but shouldn't the expectations be higher in Vegas?    I have been to several Hooters restaurants throughout California, and have been to the Vegas location 3-4 times.  I actually stayed at the hotel on one occasion during a last minute Vegas trip when my usual places were booked, so I have a thorough perspective of the hotel, bar, casino, and restaurant.  The Vegas Hooters isn't bad but it really can't compete with the other Vegas options.  The casino and bar area is sad and depressing, but the rooms are super cheap and better than the local roach motels.    I'm a guy that likes wings, beers, and stealing glances at the waitresses, but in Vegas, there are so many nicer places for the same cost, that I can't really recommend the restaurant unless you've never been to a Hooters restaurant before.  It's not bad, but there is no energy and the vibe is nonexistent.  This location is average when compared to other Hooters locations, but less than average when compared to other options in the area."
3314,train,1,"This place was beautiful. Over the top trendy, but beautiful. Everything about this place screams guilty pleasure.   The one thing my friends and I keep saying about this place was that 95% of the staff was EXCEEDINGLY nice and patient. Cocktail waitresses, bell staff, front desk, etc., were just extremely genuine and patient. But be prepared for the type of people who were staying at the hotel: DOUCHES.   The other 5% were a few of the staff inside restaurants within the hotel. In particular, this blond middle aged man who was our server at The Henry, their 24 hour restaurant. Worst restaurant server I've ever had. The kind of guy who acts like you're bothering him by patronizing the place he works at. He NEVER refilled out drinks (isn't that Serving 101?), and was annoyed every time we ordered something else. My food was pretty amazing though- the french dip with truffle tater tots. The other bad experience was with the pool server, who pretended to forget to bring us our change from $100 bill because her shift was over. We literally had to hunt her down after 30 minutes and report it to the manager.  The Wicked Spoon buffet was one of the best I've had in Vegas. Most of the food they offer comes portioned in miniature pots, dishes, fryer baskets, whatever was appropriate for the dish. It was all too adorable. Some of the food was slightly bland, but the selection and the fresh taste was top-notch.   We stayed in a room with two beds, and it was pretty baller. Two flat screen TVs, a deep tub with jets, sitting area, balcony with a huge comfy chair, and the beds were just heavenly- like sleeping in a cloud. One lame thing was that the room did not come with complimentary coffee. Very frustrating, but I guess they figure if you can afford the room, you can afford $5 more for a pot of coffee.   We had a huge problem with the tub. The jets would turn on by themselves throughout the night, startling us awake. We reported it the first two times as it was happening, and reported the rest in the morning. They were very nice and gave us a complimentary buffet to make up for our lost night of rest."
7461,train,1,"I've not stayed at the Cosmopolitan, but I've spent a lot of time walking through here and dining here, and it makes me want to stay! It's beautiful and modern looking and they have so many great restaurants. On my last stay in Vegas 3 of our Meals were at the cosmopolitan. It seems like almost every visit to Vegas I end up visiting a couple of the restaurants in the Cosmopolitan. I'd definitely like to stay here someday!"
6803,train,-1,"In a word: Meh.  Dammit I need more words. Fine.  Have stayed at the Cosmo when it first opened, and it was fine. Reaction was neutral - not anything I'd write a review on. My main complaint this time around stems from the interaction with the check-in agent. Initially he was affable, engaging in friendly banter as he tried to up-sell us to a larger suite. However, after we declined several times, he completely shut down. Gone were the smile, personality and willingness to use his breath and facial muscles to form additional words to communicate. His attitude degraded to that of a side-of-the-interstate, $40/night motel clerk, barely surviving his soul-sucking graveyard shift as he angrily ponders the terrible choices he made in life. I wasn't looking for much more than a happy, ""have a great stay!"" but that was simply too much for him to muster.  While we tried to look past the front desk experience, it became clear that the attitude carried through in the overall mediocrity of our stay. While I had hoped to be wowed by the amenities and accommodations, I was disappointingly underwhelmed, adding further to my dismay. Rooms were ok (run-down and old looking). Wicked Spoon was ok, definitely nothing compared to Bacchanal at Caesars. Did not see the ""unique and different"" vibe this hotel has been marketing. This experience was hardly ""Cosmopolitan"" and never worth the expense."
7422,train,1,"The Cosmo is swank and posh and I love it. The rooms are fantastic and the location is perfect. The valet and parking garage are very accessible. There is human security at the elevators, but keycards ARE required."
4607,train,-1,"Not a fan. Everyone here is on island time and island speed.   We had the website reservations error on us. We waited about 30 mins, two hang ups and talked to four people before it got corrected.   Upon checking in, valet was no where to be found. The checkin desk was extremely slow and not organize.   The room are basic and what I expect for the price. I had no problems with the beds. The casino is tiny.   When we went to leave, valet was no where in sight again. The waited a good 10 mins, and went to the valet/bell door.   For $50 a night during a trade show I would stay here again, but for priced more, on a vacation or quick get away I would not."
6208,train,1,"Hands down the best hotel in Vegas. The crowd is young and beautiful and Marquee day club is poppin'. I can easily say I've had one of the best times of my life at this hotel. So many celebrities stay at the Cosmo and I saw a bunch of athletes last time I stayed here. Marquee may be a little difficult to get into but if you're walking around with stacks you can easily get it. In Vegas you gotta go big or go home so if you want to be thrifty, the Cosmo ain't the place to stay. First time I gambled at this place I won $300 off $10 in slots. Staying at the Cosmo was such a memorable experience."
2113,train,1,"At the room rate under $170 a night I'm a fan.  Over that and given the resort fee I'm not a player.  I get tired of high resort fees.  The restaurants are good but pretty expensive considering.  Service is usually attentive but the Cosmo is a scene that is hip and a nice option on the strip.  If you're a business traveler, it may be nice for a change.  THe check in and check out times are horrendous.  This is somewhat the case if you stay on the strip.  Otherwise, getting in and out if you stay off the strip it's a nice alternative.  The rooms are awesome but it's not a business traveler market place.  It's a hip place to spend some time."
7558,train,1,"Okay here's THE SCOOP on The Cosmo:  * Conveniently located in the middle of the Vegas strip.  * Hands down, the leading modern/contemporary Hotel/ Casino of its caliber in Vegas.  Polished steel accents, shreds of light and glass move above you as you walk in.  Elements of sexy appear from the first step in through the lobby and follow into the casino floors. Fascinating design from furniture, art pieces, and installations run consistently through The Cosmo create a modern-contemporary feel. Similar to what would be seen in a GQ magazine spread.  AVANT-GARDE - ALLURING - STATE OF THE ART  * When it comes to young and hip ambiance I'd say Encore comes close, but The Cosmo is far more ahead in position.   Exceptionally nice and helpful dealers on the casino floors were a plus :)   * Club Marquee (the largest club I've ever been to) and shops on the second floor.   Cool, upbeat and fun people usually hang here. (especially around the weekend & monday nights.)   All in all, The Cosmo left a sharp and tasteful impression with me.  _S"
5651,train,-1,"My girlfriend and I spent four nights at the Cosmopolitan in early June.  This was my third time staying at this property and will likely be my last.  The hotel is nice, rooms are spacious, well designed and have great views and China Poblano was an excellent casual restaurant.    The reason for this review is the casino, on our second evening in Vegas, my girlfriend and I decided to enjoy the property and play blackjack.  She was wearing a dress with no pockets so I had her ID and our cash in my wallet.  I handed the dealer $200 for chips on a $15 table and gave her half anticipating each of us playing for a while.  The dealer (Andy) told me that the bet was $25 at this $15 table because I controlled both hands.  I was clear when handing the cash that we were each playing and split the chips evenly.  She is an experienced player and capable of controlling her own hand.  Andy's view was it was from one 'bankroll' (not true).  I was holding both of our cash on this evening.  Andy would not budge so I asked to talk to the pit boss who informed me that Andy was correct but he could make a one time exception.  I disagreed, left, cashed the chips in and asked to speak with a hotel manager and the casino manager (Jim).  Neither was helpful, they did not ask my room number and despite acknowledging a need to improve training, did not give me the feeling that this would not happen again and they obviously did not circle back with me during my stay.  We did have a great visit to Vegas and will continue to enjoy the entertainment in future stays.  The challenges at our base hotel casino allowed us to sample several other casinos (we would have anyway) both on the strip and downtown.  The Cosmo was the only resort that had an issue with me handing over the cash, most dealers asked if it was for both of us and had no issue when I confirmed it was.    My advise is to stay at one of the resorts linked to larger casino groups with better customer service training.  It would have improved our experience."
4578,train,-1,"The rooms are decent, but customer service is lacking.  They wouldn't honor my reservation (paid online) for a non-smoking room b/c they are ""too booked"" and the receptionist just turned her head away from us.  Then her colleague who heard our complaint walked over and told us that we could make a request the next day  in case ppl move out.  So when we returned the next day the same lady (should have looked up her name tag) told us that we should have made our room-change request at 6 AM, seriously 6 AM? ::curse curse::"
1561,train,-1,If you want to go back into time and feel like you are in a Bad B movie then I would say check this place out.  I just stopped by to use the bathroom while walking the Fremont Experience and also wanted the Football Blended drink. After pushing through the crowd of people I made it to the bathroom which wasn't as bad as I thought. I couldn't imagine staying here and in all honesty I couldn't get out of there quick enough. We couldn't find someone to help us with the drink so we just left. One bathroom visit was enough for me.
2177,train,0,"Great for a long airport stay at PHX. Walking distance from dunkin donuts which is a very good thing. Good service, free airport shuttle, and the complex is pretty nice. The rooms leave a lot to be desired, but it was OK for the price range. I would likely go back if I had another long stop-over in the area."
5271,test,1,Can I say  Wow!!! This is the most Classiest Hotel/ Casino in Vegas. This beats Encore x10!! They put style in everything from the lobby to the parking areas!  There is not a dull look anywhere in side this property.  The staff is very helpful with everything. Its a must go!
2175,train,0,"Got a room on their website for a junior king suite for $79. Not bad considering it's less than ten minutes drive to old town Scottsdale and fashion square. It was nice to get a good buzz at the free cocktail hour before going out for the night.. Sure saved us some money. Unlimited free drinks for an hour and a half? Sign me up. The rooms do have a musty smell and are tacky and cheap, if you did want a mini kitchen while you're staying here I suppose that would be a positive, but we didn't need it. Very small room and bathroom, no better than a motel 6. Our room looked out onto the pool courtyard which was pretty and quiet. The pool was heated which was nice because we happened to have freak weather the night that we stayed there (raining and 40s temperatures) so it was nice to still swim. Also has a very small hot tub. Overall good value for the price, next time we'll spend the extra money and go somewhere nice though."

9449,train,1,"Welcome to downtown Cleveland. Having this been my first review of the Marriott, let it be known I've stayed here more than once. Location is great, staff members are friendly, hotel bar/restaurant is pretty damn good. If you're looking for a $100/nt hotel... this is NOT your place. Though you might get a pretty good deal on hotels.com Remember it's a Marriott. Location in my opinion is perfect. Pretty close to everything. Restaurants Bars etc...My rooms were good size Beds were GREAT. Hope this helps. Highly recommend this Marriott."
5577,train,0,"I'll preface my remarks by saying that I didn't actually stay at Hooter's myself.  A buddy of mine who was in Vegas at the same time I was and stayed there.  I was at another hotel and visited to take a look around.  All I can say is, Wow!  I never would have though that they could have made a hotel so much like a restaurant!  The signature orange colors and wood flooring are seen throughout the casino, restaurants and rooms.  They've even got small tables and stools in the rooms like they do at the restaurant!  I never would have believed it!  The pool area looked nice, although a little rundown.  This was in Dec 2008, so it may have just been that the cold weather and the winds that were blowing through were keeping things from looking perfect.  I'd equate the rooms to a Red Roof Inn or Days Inn.  Nothing at all fantastic.  Standard, uncomplicated bedding.  Chips and scratches in the paint and signs of being somewhat rundown.  Nothing too scary, but noticable.  From what my buddy said the ""free slot plays"" are kind of cheesy.  You're required to use certain machines to play, have to play with higher amounts, and can't really make too many choices for yourself.  He was not particularly impressed.  We did nosh on the breakfast buffet on our last day (thanks 2-for-1 coupon!) and it was decent.  Much what I would expect a Hooters restaurant to serve if they served breakfast.  They also had great buffalo wing deals after 12 midnight, but by the time we were done hitting the town we pretty much just crashed as soon as we got back, and never made it to the tables.  Basically I'd say that you get what your pay for.  My buddy paid something like $39/night for the room and understood that that wouldn't be getting him a stay in a 5-star joint.  But when you're out on the town most of your trip and don't spend too much time in your room, is an expensive room worth it???"
4118,train,0,"Basic hotel, incomparable to other hotels/suites I've stayed in Vegas. Nothing much going on really. Our hotel room is clean okay...but plain and dull. Also no microwave, need to pay extra if we want fridge in the room. We have tiny patio but we are directly above their generator (I think) so it's noisy when we go there. Basic pool area, no character. It's somewhat cheaper that most hotels. But if you think about it, just adding $20-$50 a night you get a nicer-looking hotel with better location.  Anyways, it's good that it's near MGM monorail, also their hotel staff are accommodating, no complaints about that, plus free valet parking. Complimentary bottled water every day, has coffee-maker, hair drier, iron, and decent-sized table. So all in all still gonna give them 3 stars! But hopefully they will revamp their facilities to be at par with other Vegas hotel."
7729,train,1,"The total experience at the Cosmopolitan was fantastic!   We upgraded to a room overlooking the water show at the Bellagio and the strip but that wasn't all this room offered....it also had a great balcony, soaking tub with a view and was well decorated and spacious.   We enjoyed the Marquee day club and night club as well as the Chandelier Bar a few times during our long weekend stay.  The fresh contemporary design of the hotel, friendly customer service of not only the front office staff (Mark) but also the housekeeping staff and security made our visit a memorable weekend.  We're already planning a return trip with the decision of where we'll stay taken care of:-)"
3884,train,-1,ROACHES!!!  This review might be a little hard to believe but this is true. I've stayed at the Cosmo many times before and have always loved the hotel and almost everything about it. But I just came back today from my most recent stay and had to share my story.  My room was in the West Tower - 18th floor. While in the shower yesterday morning I looked down to find a HUGE roach crawling in the shower at my feet. Needless to say I screamed and was completely traumatized and jumped out immediately. This was no ordinary roach. It was probably 2-inches long and 1-inch wide with wings. The kind I've only seen in Asia. It did not crawl up from the drain because the drain holes were way too small to fit this monster through.  I called the hotel staff and they changed my room immediately and offered a food and beverage comp. Even though they addressed the issue I don't think that they really believe what was in my shower with me because no one came by to see it for themselves. But I do have this photo in case anyone from the hotel would like to validate my story.  UPDATE: They sent us a bed bug report ... not sure why considering our issue was with giant roaches ... not bed bugs
983,train,-1,Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.
7498,train,1,"This place is always jumping! Action on the floor, music going, tons of people. Easy access to pedestrian bridge to crossover the other side.  The Henry restaurant is small and has excellent food. This is always a place I visit when in town."

Walking through this hotel to get to these places were alot of fun. Random things all over the place. Maybe not those bunnies on the commercials, but shoes in the middle of nowhere, cool cigarette dispenser looking things offering artwork. Sparkly stuff. I loved walking through this place and hope to one day stay here and party at the Marquee."
9837,train,1,We golfed twice here this week and love this course. It has some really nice advantages from the forward tees and the ball goes a mile on the dry surfaces. Staff is nice and there are great views.   Tee off before 8 am for a cooler round in the summer. Plenty of drinking water on the course.  Great pricing through GolfNow. Sometimes the pro shop can natch it other times they won't. Guess it depends who is working the register.
6246,train,0,"I am a frequent traveler, and was able to redeem points for this stay through Marriott.  I checked in around 4:00 p.m., and my room was ready at the time.  I assume my Marriott Platinum status got me my upgrade to a Terrace Suite.  PROS: - (If you're able to get the right room) The view of the Bellagio fountains. - Location on The Strip, not far from everything. - Well thought-out lighting system in the room.   Love the ability to change the climate control and/or switch all of the lights on or off from inside the bed through the phone unit or the TV remote. - Wicked Spoon, the buffet, was pretty darn good (and for $32, it should be).  For whatever reason, the wi-fi in Wicked Spoon (using my iPhone) was the fastest I have ever seen hotel wi-fi do. - Secret Pizza Place has great pizza.   There are no signs in the hotel that firect you to this place, you have to ask for directions.   Definitely worth it, feels like an old Jersey-style pizza place, down to the old video games and the cheap sign displaying the menu. - The parking system, where you can easily see which spot is available or not from a distance. - Fast elevators.  CONS: - E-mailed the concierge folks at the address given when my reservation was confirmed, no reply to two messages sent (questions about show tickets). - Thought the pools were awfully small for such size of hotel.  Boulevard pool was filled with college-age kids trying to pick each other up (has a bar there).   Bamboo Pool was more about everyday people (with no bar). - In-room wi-fi was okay during the day, in the evenings, the speed sometimes was at a crawl. - Even after being out for four hours, they didn't freshen up my room (which makes sense, given other posters talking about rooms not being ready). - All the signs to the Boulevard Pool said 4th Floor, but when you got there an outsourced security guard said that we have to go one floor down and go up the escalator to enter.   Uh, okay.  OTHER: - I didn't play there, but the Casino was more ""there"" than it was a big thing.  - The clubs Chandelier and Marquee are hot.   I didn't go into either, but the amount of people said they're hot. - This hotel is more geared towards college-age kids trying to impress each other. - As mentioned before, I was in a Terrace Suite, so I don't know if if every room has this.....my room had a refrigerator that was full of the usual, overpriced mini-bar stuff.   The refrigerator part had the weight sensors below the goodies, so you really couldn't move anything around.   Freezer was there for whatever you want.  They label this place as a resort.  not so sure about that.....had its fair share of amenities, but I have been in other places with just as much, if not more, and was not labeled a ""resort.""    In the end, I like this place.   Don't love it, but don't hate it either."

2251,train,-1,"I'm giving this a 1-star rating and maybe they deserve better.  I was just so turned off with what happened to me at check-in.  I stayed at Hooters a couple weeks ago...booked online with what I thought was a great deal.  Booked directly from their website, because I didn't want to deal with any weird hidden fees from a third-party site like Hotwire, Orbitz, etc.  Went through the process...clicked my dates, saw the rates, saw the taxes and resorts fees...no problem!  Then I saw that they offered an additional AAA discount, so i was feeling pretty good!  Then when I got there and checked in they said they had already applied the AAA discount.  Not sure how that was possible.  I never inputted any code or anything, so how did they know I had a AAA membership?  The site says they offer a AAA discount when you show proof at check in.  So I tried to explain to two females (one said she was a manager) the situation and they looked at me like I had 25 heads.  They insisted the discount was already applied to my rate when I booked.  I insisted it wasn't (because that was the truth)!  I understand things get messed up, but their behavior toward me was ridiculous.  At first they were very nice, then when I politely explained they were wrong, they both got very defensive and tried to make me feel like an idiot.  Then I got a little upset because a) i was right b) they were wrong c) they insisted I was wrong and d) they were rude.    The rest of my stay was fine...decent room for the price, not a far walk to The Strip, cheap tables, etc, etc.    However, I'm big on customer service and this place has NONE.  Never going back there.  Oh one other thing, they said there's wireless Internet...Not in my room.  You're barely in the room in Vegas, so not a huge deal I guess.  Just more lack of customer service."

8897,test,1,"We ended up coming here because had an excellent prime rib dinner for $9.99 at the Cafe Grand and every time the waitresses would walk by with something else off the menu I had food envy!  We stayed at the Stratosphere every year and the last few times the would really screw up our reservations. This time I said screw it let's stay at Boulder Station at least we know we will like the food.   We were shocked to find the room newly remodelled beautifully! Loved the art! Flat screen TV, new bathroom, the works.  Clean!   The Casino did have an old musty smell when you walked in by that in no way should stop you from staying here. For $20 a night, plus $13 for internet, spa, pool (til 10), gym, etc.   Make sure to get your ""boarding pass"" their players card so you can skip to the VIP line for the buffet. Hint if you go at 10:30am you can hit it just right to have either or both breakfast and lunch."
6310,train,1,"5-starz all the way around! The rooms are fantastic, weather its the city view basic room or a wrap around corner suite you will definitely love your stay. The restaurants and bars are really good as well. Layout of the casino and restaurants is perfect, every area from the tables to the chandelier room flows effortlessly. The entire casino is very stylish with a Bossonova type of motif. While at the casino make sure to have a drink in the chandelier room upstairs and ask for the menu, the specialty drinks are really good. Also, make sure to attend the night club Marquee, you will not be disappointed. Monday nights are the best night to attend the Marquee, the crowd is not as rowdy. During the week the best nights to stay at the Cosmopolitan are Monday thru Wednesday, you will get the best rates and the casino is not full of weekend warriors. Overall the casino is walking distance to and from other properties and malls. The beautiful upscale boutique mall Crystals is within walking distance as is the Miracle-Mile mall shops. The fountain show at the Bellagio is also a short 5 minute walk as well."

7816,train,1,"Let me start by saying that I am reviewing the cosmopolitan while staying in a Terrace suite. This is important because I have seen the regular rooms and they are not impressive. We were going to an event at the cosmopolitan so decided to get a room there. It was not cheap! It was a large room of about 900 ft.Â² and another 100 ft.Â² was a balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Not too shabby!. Prior to taxes, the room was $940. Expensive! We walked into a very small hallway that immediately opens up into a kitchen followed by a living room with a massive view of the city and then to the left is the bedroom and turn another left and there is a large bathroom. The bedroom also has a glass window patio with an amazing view of the strip. Going back to the entrance, as soon as you walk in, the first door that you will find to your left will be another bathroom with a shower. I was confused by the extra bathroom with the shower because there is only one king bed and the sofa is not meant to be slept on. Therefore, make sure to ask for an extra bed if someone else is sleeping over and you are the only one sleeping in a king bed. The room is very pretty and well compacted. The view of the city is absolutely spectacular. I will say that it is not cheap so be ready to pay a lot of money. I rated this five stars but I'm really giving it 4 1/2 stars because of how expensive it is to stay here. We paid the money because of the event we went to, where we wore very high heels and did not want to walk very far. Otherwise, we would have chosen to stay at another hotel which has large suites that are even larger than this one and the same price with an incredible view. The location is very cool yet what is great about the cosmopolitan is the large choice of venues that you have. I cannot say that shopping is impressive so I'm not even going to go there. The restaurant choices are really good and plentiful. Their spa is pretty cool and the salon is OK. Overall, I will stay here again but I hope to find a more affordable price."
5432,train,1,"Hammer! Eines der besten Hotels die ich je gesehen habe (und ich hab einige 5-Sterne-Schuppen gesehen). Stilvoll, elegant und trotzdem stylisch und schick. Sehr netter Service. Eigentlich muss man gar nicht mehr raus - und wenn man sich die verschiedenen Themen-Hotels am Strip angeschaut hat, mÃ¶chte man das auch gar nicht mehr.  Dazu kommen tolle Restaurants, wunderschÃ¶ne Pools, und vor allem auch sehr angenehmes Publikum (mag sicher auch daran liegen dass die Preise fÃ¼rs GlÃ¼cksspiel und Gastronomie hÃ¶her sind als anderswo), da fÃ¼hlt man sich gleich noch viel wohler. Wenn wieder Vegas, dann wieder Cosmopolitan!"

9960,train,1,"Color me (red) impressed! HotelRed is pretty fab! In terms of accessible and affordable hotels (outside of game days), this modern abode is tops. Let's roll down the attributes, shall we?   The location: A stone's throw away from Camp Randall and very accessible to campus. If you need to throw yourself into anything Bucky related, this is a great location.    The lobby: Clean, modern and full of red accents! I felt quite welcomed in this well lit space filed with friendly employees.   The service: Speaking of friendly, everyone I encountered from the front desk attendant to housekeeping to the concierge to the CM was quite cool. Not overly smiley-in-your-face-so-cheery-it-hurts, but perfectly amiable.   The rooms: Full kitchenettes in every room! Woot! And a nicely price honor bar to boot. The beds are quite soft and comfy with a nice view of the large LG flatscreen. The bathrooms are also very modern with a giant showerhead and sprayers. And don't forget the Aveda bath products. Don't think I didn't take those home. My one recommendation - provide each room with a pair or two of slippers or grippy socks - those concrete floors can be chilly on bare feet!   The restaurant: I ordered room service from The Wise, the restaurant downstairs. My baked mac and cheese with artichokes and pancetta was pretty delightful. If you get a chance to snack or sip at the hotel, definitely give the restaurant a go. Plus, their patio is comfortable and huge!   The amenities: Free parking, access to a few nearby fitness opportunities (health clubs, bike rentals, running trails), and complimentary chocolates and beverage upon arrival."
9324,train,1,"Stayed at the timeshare and was pleasantly surprised.  We had a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen (fully stocked). Everything was modern, clean and safe. We had a living room area with french doors leading to the bedroom.   Points to ponder: -Parking sucks. When you self-park, good luck finding your car. Its a trek!!! -Steps to Cosmo casino. We found ourselves gambling next door! -Steps from the strip. Easy access. -Elevators take forever! -Hallways are quiet. I didn't hear people walking the halls or thru the walls, etc. -Bathroom fan was really loud? -Bad view from our room but we were barely in the room. -Free movie rental and popcorn in the lobby. -There's a small convenience store in the lobby. (Items are more $$$). -You get a packet upon check-in. Read the materials because there's freebies!!!  Great option for staying on the strip!"
2638,train,-1,"As a local who has lived here for over 20 years, I have come to really  enjoy my visits to this property. This rating then, is just for my recent visit this past Saturday. We had just left a special performance of the Nevada Ballet and I was craving a good steak. When I called the Veranda, I was told that they will begin serving there lunch/dinner menu at 3:00. Perfect. When we pulled up to valet, there is "" always"" someone there to open the passenger car door for you and most of the time the hotel doors....There as only one person in valet. Told me to pull up and then walked away not even opening the door for my girlfriend. Picky....Perhaps, but it is a Four Seasons and it's part of the experience...If you have been there, you know what I mean.  Went to the Veranda and after being seated we were informed that the dinner menu would not be served until 5:00...... .We got up and just had a drink and appetizer at the bar . I was a bit upset to drive over there for nothing. I will say that the bartender was very apologetic and another person offered to ask the chef if he could prepare a steak....We declined. We really were hoping for just an early dinner. Probably just caught them on a off day....it happens...But quite honestly, being one of the top 3 hotel properties in Las Vegas, it should not have......"
3132,train,1,"I love this hotel. You are right on the strip but don't have the loud casino noises. The Four Seasons is the top few floors of the Mandalay Bay.  When you drive in, the feeling is that you're driving up to a nice, secluded, & luxurious hotel.  The service is great & the rooms are nice also. We were upgraded & ended up with the one-bedroom suite & also a crazy big suite that was larger than my apartment. All because when we got there, no rooms were available for us. At any other establishment, they would have simply made you wait - tough luck. At the Four Seasons, they upgrade you. (And also most likely they had the room available)  The rooms were clean and it was quiet. Every time we went back to the hotel, it was a serene oasis from all the noise. A definite recommend!"

5815,test,1,"I am not a gambler but playing the slots at this casino, it did not really bother me that I was losing money!  I played Wheel of Fortune and only won a couple of dollars.  However, I feel like the free drinks made it a little easier on my wallet.  Dionne, who worked at the casino was very helpful when the machines did not work.  I stayed two nights and would have stayed longer if the rate did not jump to $600 for a Friday and the hotel was completely booked on Saturday.  I was never bored staying here.  The room was comfortable.  Though my view was of the airport I still enjoyed watching the sunrise.  The only downside to staying on the high floor was the wind howling throughout the night!  The room was small but very comfortable. It was spacious and loved the design of the bathroom!  The shower, the sink, very modern.  The staff was very accommodating,  The gym was fantastic.  I liked the boxing ring and the yoga room!  Whenever there was an issue I could just call the help desk and a resolution was reached within minutes. The parking garage was easy to navigate.  I liked the location of the hotel because it was a short walk to see the Bellagio fountain's or walk to Caesar's for shopping and dining. I would definitely return to this hotel the next time I take a Vegas vacation."
7582,train,1,"Stayed here over the summer and am just now getting around to writing a review; better late than never!  In short, this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Reasons:  - The room is spacious and nice. The hotel has a modern, sexy vibe, and that carries over into the rooms as well. Perfectly place for a kid-less trip to Vegas with my wife.  - The balcony. We got a lot of use out of that balcony. In the morning I was able to sit out there with my coffee and watch the sunrise, and at night, we were able to look over the edge and catch an aerial view of the MIA concert just below us.    - The facilities. Every place we went to (the chandelier bar, China Poblano, Scarpetta, etc.) were all fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this if you need a nice place to stay in Vegas."
1260,train,1,"David, the French front desk guy, is amazing. Took really good care of us, made sure our shuttle got us in time, and went above & beyond.   Depending on the shuttle drivers, you can have good to great. The female one we got one night was so amicable and charming -- it was a pleasure to have ridden with her. Another guy was helpful in finding the nightlife, and another was very efficient. All of them, save one who was a young man, were very courteous. Restaurant staff are also very good.   The breakfast buffet was at first a little difficult to navigate, but got it eventually. You get a ticket that shows the day you can redeem your meals. We sat at a booth with a TV (all of them have one) and sat through a 1/2 hour of Christian conservative TV until we realized you would actually change the channel (the remote was on resting on the booth seat area, behind my head.)"
7157,test,1,"One of my favorite hotels! Love the service, decorations and non smoking casinos they offer. The only negative things were:   The shower in our suite would start with freezing water then turn scolding hot.   The tv and lamp in the living room turned on at 2am every night. We'd turn off an it'd turn on again. I think there was a short circuit so we unplugged as it happened two nights in a row at the same time.   We tried more restaurants this visit and were glad. China Pablano has amazing food, as well as the Italian eateries. I have also posted reviews of my favorite restaurants. Plus who doesn't love All Saints! Love the shops located right in the hotel. If you've never been to Vegas the Cosmo is located next to Bellagio, Paris and Planet Hollywood it has an amazing location.   Also be sure to join the rewards club. For each dollar you spend on food, massage, certain gambling you earn points that can be redeemed for items/used as cash. If you spend $1000 you will earn a free night plus points. Not bad if you wanted something at All Saints anyways, whatnot get points for it!"
5064,train,1,"Best hotel I've ever stayed in on the Strip.  Terrace Studio Fountain View - Gorgeous view of the Strip overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The bathroom is beautiful. I never want to leave.  Service - Excellent and accommodates everything. I asked for some lotion, and they sent 5 bottles. The concierge had answers to every question. You can even check out online.   Restaurants - Visited Wicked Spoon, Secret Pizza, Momofuku, and Milkbar. There's enough to entertain you for one day. There's not much shopping. The bars are very pretty.   Casino Floor - It doesn't smell like smoke. Cocktail waitresses spawn out of nowhere and are very sweet. Every staff member treated us wonderfully, even though it was my first time gambling.  Parking, Uber, Garage - Convenient and easy access."
3991,train,1,"If you want quiet and a private entrance into your hotel, this is the place to stay.  The room, the views, everything about this hotel is perfect.  At Christmas time the lobby is decorated lavishly.  Highly recommend for a romantic stay in VEGAS."

6777,train,-1,"HANDS DOWN THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD IN VEGAS!!!!!  My friends and I got in Friday night to the Cosmopolitan.  We were pretty excited because the Cosmo is a fancy hotel and we had heard their night club was fun. We went to Marquee for a couple hours and then decided to go gamble.  I left my friends so I could go use the restroom.  Well you know how you can easily get turned around in a casino.  I was wondering around by myself for a hot minute trying to find my friends.  A security agent approached me asking to see my ID.  Not a problem at all.  I gave it to him and made a joke about how he made my night because I'm 30.  He completely ignores me and starts saying my name into his radio.  Thinking that he'd only wanted to see my ID to verify age, I asked him what was going on.  He held up his hand and shushed me.  Well I'm sorry but I'm a grown women staying at your hotel and you've taken my ID and aren't giving me any details.  This has now upset me.  I ask him again what's going on and he continues to talk into his radio.  I tell him I want my id back and he tells me I need to calm down.   Still not explaining to me what's going on.  I told him I was staying at hotel and he asked my room number.  I left one number off on accident and he tells me I'm lying bc that's not even a room there.  He then tells me I have to leave.  He walks my outside and tells me to leave.  Well at this point I'm a little frantic because my friends are inside and I'm being kicked out of the hotel FOR NO REASON!!!!  I come straight back inside and so they call metro police on me.  A gang unit.  Yes a single female staying at Cosmo with some friends had a gang unit called on her FOR NO REASON!  I'm being argued with and held and still no one is telling me what I have done wrong.  Finally the shift manager from security comes and pulls me aside and speaks to me in much more respectful manor.  He explains it's protocol to stop people that might be part of ""suspicious activity"".  Yes, that's right I was being confused for an escort.  I paid for an expensive room at The Cosmopolitan only to be held for 15 minutes because I could possibly be taking part in suspicious activity as I walk around lost looking for my friends.  Well needless to say I am beyond upset at this point.  They finally check to see that my name is in their system as being a guest.  Couldn't they have done that within first 5 minutes and avoided all this?  Avoided offending and embarrassing me in front  people in the casino watching the whole debacle take place!  I get to leave finally and return to my friends.  The next day we go straight to the security office to file a complaint.  We thought for sure the Cosmopolitan would be very apologetic and quite frankly embarrassed that their security treated a guest this way.  Not at all!  I barely got an apology.  I was informed I can email risk management and that could take up to two weeks to hear back.  We then decided to go to guest services.  Surely someone on their staff is going to want to rectify this situation.  Surely The Cosmopolitan isn't ok with treating guest this way.  Haha wow was I wrong.  The senior manager at guest services was condescending and rude.  He implied that it was my fault.  Saying that ""metro police had a negative experience with me.""  Ya think?  You held me without reason for 15 minutes in the assumption I was an escort!  Most people would be livid!  I spoke with 4 different departments at the Cosmopolitan and no one was helpful.   It seems this is standard for them.  Unless you want to risk being harassed by security, I would stay far far away from The Cosmopolitan.  There are plenty of wonderful hotels on the strip that treat their guest with respect.   My friends and I will not be returning!"
5767,train,1,"On arrival check in appeared so busy but the efficiency of the friendly staff made it a quick & easy process.  Kalina was very welcoming & helpful & got us settled quickly.  She accommodated our high floor request & we were situated in the west wing, giving us the most amazing view of the bellagio fountains, ceasars palace & the strip. 1 bedroom suite fountain view was perfectly sized & well worth it. Staff at this hotel are second to none & always extremely helpful & friendly. Would stay here again for sure!"
2643,train,1,"Four Seasons Las Vegas is the first hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, before Hacienda Road.  The hotel is easy to miss so just look for Mandalay Bay and there you will find it.  The reason the resort is hidden is because Four Seasons Vegas occupies the 35th to 39th floors of Mandalay Bay.  There is a separate private drive and entrance to Four Seasons Hotel, as well as a private access area from the Mandalay Bay casino to Four Seasons.  Four Seasons Las Vegas is a non-gaming casino, rooms are comfy- Four Seasons style with L'occitane bath products, a surprisingly tiny spa-free access to hotel guests for amenity usage and a separate jacuzzi and pool from Mandalay Bay.  If you wanted to gain access to the Mandalay Bay pool it is possible.  I never spend much time in my room at this Four Seasons destination but when the time comes to crash and lay my head down, Four Seasons Vegas is a comfy spot.  For less money the Trump is just as relaxing if not more; plus at Trump you have a kitchenette.  Viva Las Vegas!"

4119,train,-1,Very bad casino experience! Ran down feel and also doesn't seem that legit. We weren't staying there but visited and some of the runs I saw on roulette were comical and repetitive. When we walked in I heard many different people complaining about how sketchy it was but thought they were just losing and having a bad day but saw it first hand. A lot of great places on the strip but this one is one to o stay away from!
7873,test,1,"AMAZING! This hotel went beyond all of our expectations!  We arrived, late, nearly midnight I would say.  We went to the registration desk to check-in and found out our room was not ready because they thought we were a no show.  To compensate they immediately gave us a $50 food and beverage credit.  The lady checking us in then gave us a room with a view of the Bellagio water show which we thought was pretty cool.  On our way up they called us back and told us they upgraded us to a balcony studio room/suite on the 58th floor. This room was AMAZING and the view was even better than the first room!  Saturday morning we came back from Vanity and ordered room service, we were able to get a huge pizza for only $26. That is awesome for room service, considering that the following night my friend ordered a $40 hamburger HA!  Overall, we got a fantastic deal and paid about a third of what those rooms are going for now!    * There were two things that I disliked, one was the TV would not shut off and was blaring all night long. My friend did not want to bother engineering and ended up eventually unplugging it.   * And the other was there was always a long wait time when calling room service and concierge.  Other than those two items the Cosmo is amazing!"

FSLV has 500 rooms located at 35-39th floor which each covers North, East and West areas of the MGM International property, Mandalay Bay.  [Greeted with the grand Four Seasons Fountain, Phil was able to assist us with our bags in a swift and welcoming manner. He directed us the way to Veranda and made sure that our bags got to our room safely.]  There are five dining options for your needs: Charlie Palmer Steakhouse, Veranda, Press, Pool and In-Room Dining. Four Seasons has one pool but Four Seasons guests has access to all Mandalay Bay pools as well, when ordering drinks or food though, you cannot charge it to your room unless you are at the FS pool.  [On our first day, Sunday. We ate at Veranda, a poppin' weekend brunch buffet where we were able to indulge on a variety of traditional American brunch, breakfast pastries, an omelet station and last but not least, a freshly made donut station. Thank you Louie for providing a speedy and friendly service.  We also ordered In-Room Dining through Kaitlyn, she made sure that our order was taken correctly.]  Four Seasons Hotel has also a private entrance, so if you are taking a cab there you have to say that you are staying at the Four Seasons. Also Four Seasons has also another private access to the Mandalay Bay Casino.   Although on the spa was under construction on the duration of my stay. I enjoyed getting my nails done at the spa. I also enjoyed the pool and their mango daquiri.  [Although there was a bit of a hiccup on our stay, Mia and Sandy from the front desk were able to listen and empathize to my concerns and were able to ensure that my problems were resolved. Which I truly appreciate and I cannot say enough how much they made my stay less stressful. Super thanks! Also I would also like to thank my reservation agent, Jazzy, for assisting me with my booking needs. Thank you Belky for assisting me when I was inquiring about the amenities. Thank you for the IRD manager, I didn't catch his name, for reaching out and assisting me to make our stay and sending such a beautiful amenity. Super appreciate it and we never wanted to leave.]"
5829,test,1,"From outside the hotel looks like this skinny building with not much to offer...but this hotel blew my mind. Took a taxi to the hotel to go to Marquee and it's very well lit and filled with people. The decor is very urban, posh and full of sex appeal. Love how the restroom near the entrance has a chain monument separating the men and women's restroom, while allowing us to take a peek at any attractive guests walking by. ;)  Men and women are everywhere. We were constantly getting hollered at...great for a self esteem booster!  The chandelier bar is gorgeous! Drinks prices are a bit steep ($15 each)....but the bartenders got some heavy hands!!!  I definitely want to stay here on my next vegas trip.   Cosmopolitan's definitely got ""just the right amount of wrong""."
1054,train,-1,"Kind of like a more expensive chain breakfast/lunch location, I wasn't too impressed with this Vegas cuisine. Also random that they served a separate set of Vietnamese food if you don't feel like eating American. Average price seemed to be around the 15$ range, which was way more than it should have been. I split one of the omelets, and it was served with toast and a heaping of hash browns. Hash browns were alright, not that crispy, a bit mushy. Omelet was okay, but I wasn't that excited about it. Service felt a little odd, our server's sarcasm or the way she jokes threw me off a little bit. But at least we kept ourselves entertained by playing Keno!"

9498,train,1,"Stayed here for two nights during a recent trip to Cleveland. Dropped my car off with the valet.  Check in only took a minute. My room was on the 7th floor. Room was clean and overall comfortable. However, the bed was to mushy for my liking - I prefer a very firm mattress. Played havoc with my back.  AC in the room worked well. Flat panel TV had a number of HD channels. Internet service was free - but it sucked. It was so very slow. Then I noticed a letter stating that they were upgrading the internet access for the hotel - and that until the upgrade is complete - the internet access is free. Kind of strange - give the guests free access to crappy service! When the upgrade is completed - then they will charge a fee again. There was also a small fridge in my room.  All of the employees I encountered were very friendly. There is a small convenience store on the main level where you can get coffee, sodas, bottled water, snacks, toiletries and such.  On the main level - there is also a bar named ""Jake's"" and a restaurant called ""David's."" Food is pretty good for hotel food in both of these joints."

The hotel is in the middle of The Strip  They also have some interesting restaurants including a New York pizza place in a hidden hallway on the third floor.  Place flows well with The Chandelier bar in the middle encompassing three floors  Only downside is the gym.  It costs $20, which is ok, but you have to shower in the spa for another $30.

We were scared and it was my first blowout while driving, we pulled off to the side of the I17 right next to the Candlewood. We walked over and the lady at the front desk was soooooo nice and helpful!!! She let me use the phone to call for help, she even checked the Camara on the side of the building to make sure my car was okay, and she gave me and my son a bottle of water and a pack of eminems. I didn't get to get her name, but I am so grateful for her hospitality and for making us feel safe. She was kind of short, had long black or dark brown hair, and the time was about 7:30 pm.

This is, aside from the Wynn/Encore and Bellagio, the best.   But, why does it beat the Wynn and Bellagio, because it is at the fraction of the price.  I stayed 4 nights, $800, with all the included ameneties, access/complimentary guest to the Marquee nightclub and pool parties... and the customer service, wow, it is fantastic.  The casino is laid out so you DON'T get lost in a maze and sea of slot machines, the bars are elegant and nicely dispersed throughout the floor, there are 4 distinct pools, and the hotel rooms are nicely, nicely done.  And the staff is elegantly dressed; very impressive."
9867,train,0,"Ok, so booking a hotel last minute for Vegas for Memorial day weekend was probably not my best idea. So trying to find a hotel on Thursday for Saturday was a little difficult, because as we found the reasonably priced deals through several of the hotel search sites (travelocity, expedia, orbitz, hotels.com, and kayak) they would get swooped up and become unavailable. So I ended up staying at the Candlewood (although from the pictures that I saw and reviews I read, I thought it would be much seedier).   The were nicer and larger than I expected.   One of the washcloths had a bloodstain on it. Yuck.  The power went out for an hour and a half from 3:30 am to 5 am. I wanted to smoke a cigarette in there, but I didn't want my boyfriend waking up freaking out because I was smoking a cigarette and couldn't turn the air on. This also meant I couldn't leave the room with my sleeping boyfriend in it because he sleeps like a rock and no amount of knocking would get him to answer the door for me; power being out means the keycard wouldn't work).   Otherwise it was a pleasant stay. Its not too far off strip and there's a strip mall next to it."

Well damn right then!!  I was a guest at Cosmo Hotel and I encountered a disgusting behavior from a Dealer, KES, at the Pai Gow table.  This old man woke up on the wrong side of the bed or he really hates his job.  My friend and I was told from the floor manager that the table will be open at 9:00pm.  We came back at 9:08pm.  The dealer KES just stared at us like wtf we doing here.  He never open his mouth to speak a word or say the table isn't ready yet.  We looked at each other like wth???  So we sat down took our money out and he said ""not open"".  We said we were told it will be at 9:00pm.  He said well it's not.  So we walked away.  Talk about PMS.  Then when we came back and on the first hand I hit 4 of a kind natural.  So I turned around and yelled out to my friends ""OMG FUCK YEAH""!!! The dealer KES had the nerve to look me in the eyes with a disgusting look and told me not to say that.  I was like wth, I can say what I want and when I want.  Who are you to tell me anything.  Especially when I was talking to my friends.  Everyone knows we seen worst and hear worst things in Vegas.  He had the balls to repeated to me again and demand me not to say it.  Dear lord, help me understand why this Dealer had the attitude to do such thing to a guest who stays at their hotel??  It was only $200 that I won, not $2000.

You know the $$$$ fish place on the second floor. YIKES the sticker price was a doozy."
112,train,1,"I had the pleasure of attending an event at this amazing hotel and let me just say, it exceeded my expectations. I have never been much of a ""hotel snob"" but this place surely set the bar high. They had me at ""dog friendly"" although the rest of the evening just got better and better. But yes, you can bring your dog, to the bar, like yes, inside and have a drink with you. Um, awesome!   There is a rich history enveloped by the hotel's ambiance and you can really tell the folks here are proud of what they have done with the place. The culture embedded in all of the tiny details really blew me away.   Chef Jose and the Wallace Tap Room really blew it out of the water.  His attention to detail was spot on, including many themes from the Prohibition era that I never would have thought of.  Our cocktails were heavenly and refreshing and the fare was delightful. I especially recommend the strawberry French toast and Pittsburgh fries.   The rooms were stunning. If you have a chance to book the General's room please do. I could live there. I couldn't stop staring at the details such as the cinematic wall paper and gorgeous pillows. I will definitely make the Taproom a staple in my social life! PS- Definitely check out their exclusive blend of Zeke's coffee. Best cup of coffee I have had in a really looong time."
2854,train,1,"We got to hooters around 2:20 PM. Tom was able to check us in. He is one of the front desk supervisor's. The check in process was fairly quick and Tom was extremely nice and tentative. At first we had a problem getting into our room, but he was able to fix the problem immediately! This is a great example of great customer service. He definitely made our stay in Vegas a lot more smooth. In the end of everything our room was pretty nice and we had a great view! Las Vegas was good to us and we hope to be back soon! Thank you."
950,train,-1,One of the worst Vegas hotel diners that I've been to. Service was super slow and it felt like our food took forever. The menu is small and way overpriced. You're better off heading next door to the Fashion Show Mall food court.
6159,train,1,Love love love this hotel! We got the wrap around terrace suite complimentary and it is pimp status! I love their lobby and the suite is incredible! I would highly recommend this place to be with friends or a sweetheart. The crowd here is young and energetic. Bars everywhere and good shops! Love this place. Best place I stayed at yet in vegas.
6901,train,0,"I love staying at this hotel. It's so modern and stylish.  However the service here is lacking.  They're generally pretty lax with cleaning your room, and giving you towels.  It takes awhile for room service.  In general, for more of a real hotel feel, it's probably a better bet to go to the Wynn or somewhere else."
3599,train,1,"Let me start off by saying I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars because it's the top of the line hotel here in vegas. I'm giving it 5 stars because I walked in with very low expectations but honestly it's not that bad. It's not the best but hey for the price it's good to me. Not far from the strip at all. I booked this hotel because my sis is law recommended it. Long story short, they ended up backing out on the vegas trip so I invited my friends. The whole time I kept telling them it was very cheapy and gross hotel (because of the reviews I read) . We walked in, had trouble checking in because we booked through expedia. My name wasn't on the reservations, took about 30 mins but whatever. It wasn't hooters fault. We got to our room and it was pleasantly clean. Restroom was clean as well. Anyway, I had a nice stay. Definitely coming back to stay here if im on a budget."
8904,train,1,"When I go to Vegas i'm there for 2 things, Eating and Gambling!  This place does both really well.     They have $.50 minimum tables for those on a budget, and $2500 max limits so you can bet high stakes if that's your game (it's mine.)  The Feast Buffet (I went from Brunch) had a lot of options, everything I had tasted amazing, they offered free champagne (for those who enjoy booze with breakfast) and the whole thing with a players club card is $9.99 per person.    The Grand Cafe (both here at the Boulder Station, and the Palace Station) is one of my favorite places to go while in vegas.  It's open 24 hours, serves a full menu, and makes one hell of a Hot open face turkey sandwich.    The rooms here are also fairly decent, I only use them to sleep and store my things. So I've never spent too much time in the room any of the times i've stayed here, but I will say the beds are firm, pillows are soft, and the AC goes down to 60.  TV selection isn't too great but again I spend a minute amount of time in the room so it means nothing to me.  Rooms here start fairly low around $29.99 and they go up for weekends to around $69.99 so book early and check vegas.com and the hotel's website for any deals.  If you're a players card holder then present your card at all times, even while booking!  They have an arcade for the kids or gaming adults, as well as a kids quest day care area inside, though the smoke in the casino is overwhelming if you're a nonsmoker so I'd advise leaving kids in the daycare for a prolonged period of time."
9989,train,1,"My family and I loved this place.  Sure the staff are college kids and probably don't know as much as they could have about families with kids and what to recommend, but they were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself is very modern, which I love.  I've never stayed in a hotel without carpet (they've got concrete floors in the rooms with rugs), but honestly ... carpet is pretty gross, hides all sorts of dirt.  So I appreciated the concrete floors, which were very clean (and I appreciate the fact that you could tell if they're dirty).    We had a king size bed (we thought it was a bit too soft) and a pull out couch bed for our 2 boys.  I believe it was a suite.  It had a balcony, a small fridge, a sink, microwave, dishes and flatware... plus wine glasses and a wine opener.  The location is really good .... great pizza place (Pizza Brutta) walking distance down the road.  We've stayed at the Ruby Marie before last year, and we liked it pretty well.  But we'll be back to HotelRed without a doubt!"
1674,test,1,"I'm not new to Vegas, not new to staying at a hotel on the strip either, however this was my first stay at the Cosmopolitan. Overall the hotel is beautiful, we had a room with a balcony, living room space, Jacuzzi tub, huge stand up shower w/ seating included inside of the shower, nice king size bed but there were a few times that needed some attention. The bed frame was very dusty, there were dust balls in the corner frame of the bed, on top of the bed frame and in the shades of the lights throughout the room. There was also collected dust along the baseboard of the water closet, also you could see where the dirt collected along the corners of the baseboard because the floor is not being mopped properly. The mini fridge hummed all night so loudly it sounded like a lawn mower was in our room. The contemporary furniture is very cool and so are the collection of different books that are in the room to look through and read. The Sahra Spa is AMAZING, the massage was relaxing and the masseur was very nice. There is a relaxing sauna and large jacuzzi with waterfall which we're excellent! The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Overall a nice place to stay and we would stay here again."
5954,train,1,"I've stayed here a couple times now and don't have a bad thing to say! There seems to be new bars, restaurants and shops every time I visit so it's nice having options and being able to try something new.   The rooms are kept very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. LOVE the large bathroom! Make sure to get a fountain view room -- the view is absolutely amazing, especially at night. Worth the extra money!!"
1598,train,0,"Staff is amazing, rooms are compact, no pool. Ice on lower floor only but steps from Tim Hortons and fabulous park around the corner.  Streetcar can be caught just up block but subway station is four locks away. Convenience store across street is well stocked but pricey.  Ideal location for downtown stay but the budget minded.  If you go, do NOT miss the Loblaws in Maple Leaf Gardens. Take out section is amazing!"
6721,train,1,VIDEO of our stay: http://vimeo.com/21425892  We saw the original commercial and then decided to stay at the hotel because it looked so awesome. It turns out that the majority of the commercial was shot on a set so we couldn't even replicate the actual scenes. Regardless we had fun and that hotel is so fresh.
3539,train,0,"The only thing smoking here are the gamblers.  Oh, and some of the old ladies at the pool were yesterday afternoon too.  Value:  for an average of about $22 a night plus resort fee ($11.15), it's an excellent price. Other cheap hotel/casinos in the area charging in the same range seem to be The Riviera, The Stratosphere, and Circus Circus.  I prefer this for the location as it's easy to walk to the MGM, New York New York, Planet Hollywood, and The Cosmopolitan. Plus, it's not as lame.  Room:  it's a nice place to sleep, the bed and pillows are comfortable.  If it wasn't Hooters, the decor would be kinda tacky, with the orange chair and lamps, as well as the green, yellow, and orange leaf designed comforter.  You can easily hear every sound your neighbors make though, which was really the main downside.  Casino:  it's really small, you can't get lost here.  Everything is within eye sight.  Some of the girls working as dealers do have the Hooters outfits on, but like I opened up the review with, nothing smoking hot really.  The casino is pretty low key.  Gym/Pool/Resort Fee:  most of us have accepted resort fees, but they don't give you much for it here. You get two 12 oz. water bottles daily.  The gym has 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and some free weights and about 7 machines/benches combined.  There was hardly anyone ever at the pool, but it was nice enough.  WiFi was a plus.  Staff:  the guy working the Bell Services most of the time gave the impression he was always being bothered, as well as the chick at the front desk.  When I called the phone # listed for assistance, no one picked up the first 2 times. Maids did a good job though.  Dining: with lots of great places in walking distance, I did not eat at the Hooters restaurant or any of their other restaurants.  I only rated 3 stars due to the value.  As I had a 6 night stay in Vegas that was a deciding factor.  For the value it's definitely worth it.  If I was staying somewhere else I wouldn't stop by the casino or restaurants here.  In fact, I really didn't even when I was staying here."
7837,train,1,"SO BEAUTIFUL! Just pulling into the valet, I was already in AWE. We walk in, the really koo picture screens on the mirrors. WOW!   My fav would have to the be the Chandelier room. That was super GORG! Next time, I want to stay here!"
393,train,1,"This is a very nice resort.  We had a suite and it was very big and comfy.   Wish they had regular refrigerators and not the honor bar fridge.  A/C ran constantly because of the heat, but room stayed comfortable.  We wanted to us the nice balcony but it was just too hot.  Staff is very friendly.  They would say hi and smile when passing them on the road or around the resort.  Our room keys wouldn't work when we got here, so I called and within minutes a young man came running up the stairs to give us new ones.    I spent time in the spa, very few people and hot tub was very hot.  Attendants were very nice and attentive.  I do like how they have a separate adult pool.    Only downside was the long walk to the cars and spa and front desk.  They need to run a continual limo golf cart around the property to pick people up.    Overall a very nice long weekend.  Our room had a perfect view of the fireworks so that was an unexpected bonus!  I'm sure we will be back...when it's cooler!"
2851,train,-1,"Used to eat here it was always my favorite place to eat on the strip. Foods is great but due to my last experience there I'm not sure I'd ever eat there again. This short blonde hair ""bitch"" who happened to be the hostess that night was being really rude and ignoring my seating requests even though I was going to wait. Then she had the odasity to call me a bitch to another blonde hostess. I'm not sure if she noticed me and my boyfriend were right there... I was sure to get her name before I left MARIAH. As long as she is there I won't be coming back. Ever. Bad customer service and I just don't need that. This Vegas I expect top quality service."
3392,train,-1,"I read some of the other reviews and thought ""that can't be right"", well it is.  First black hairs in the bathroom sink, appears to be leftover from shaving and brushing very short hair.  Real glass glasses, not in a cover, not using those.  Walkin shower has faucet at the far end which means it's a surprise when you are trying to adjust the water from ice cold to warm the very first time.  Wifi...never more than 2 bars and often stops while phone is looking for a stronger signal.  Queen bed room is maybe 12x12, less than 3 feet around each side.  Drawers, 4 in total, very tiny, are in the night stands.  The bathroom, well....walk in 3 feet and there is the toilet.  Floor space is 3 foot across.  The young lady who checked me in was nice.  Not worth the price, long walk to Convention Center."

9262,train,-1,"Stayed at this hotel with  a sports team, it was AWFUL!!  Hotel is severely outdated decor wise (we are talking 1950's at best I.e. stucco walls in the room!), rooms smell like mold, hallways smell like urine, cooling system in the room has a continuous loud hum that does not stop. Wifi is very weak all the time, there are not enough plug ins in the rooms, and I could go on and on - it is a dump!  There are so many other hotels in the area I will pay the extra $20 and stay somewhere else next time."
2026,test,1,"I love this hotel.. When I get called here for tans, I fall enlove all over again !! Its fabulous !! The furniture is very GLAM and fabulous all the way around !!"
1614,train,1,"Habe hier vor circa 8 Jahren ein verlÃ¤ngertes Wochenende verbracht. Die Lage war zentral, das Zimmer relativ klein, aber sehr gÃ¼nstig. Das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck umfangreich und ziemlich schmackhaft.  Insgesamt verbinde ich mit diesem Hotel eines der schÃ¶nsten Wochenenden meines Lebens. Das ist zwar nicht allein Leistung des Hotels, aber ein Lob dafÃ¼r soll es heute trotzdem dafÃ¼r bekommen. Es gingen noch viele Jahre ins Land, in denen wir jeden Hotelaufenthalt mit diesem hier verglichen. WeiÃ du noch, damals? Im Hansa-Hotel? Hachja. Herzlichen Dank dafÃ¼r!"
4760,train,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel.  And that is an understatement.  I stayed here during a very busy weekend--in fact, I believe the Saturday  during my stay was 100% sold out.  Originally, we booked the studio suite for the kitchenette, which is one step up from the regular room.  Coming prepared, my friends and I packed more than 10 tv dinners for us to eat in our room for post-club munchies, snacks, etc.  However, when we checked in, there were no more studio suites available!!  The gentleman checking us in, offered to give us the city room (downgrade) plus $50 resort credit.  But, my friend and I kept insisting that we needed a microwave for all our food.  We tried requesting just a microwave, but they don't have microwaves at request.  The gentleman made a phone call and seconds later, the manager comes out and tells us there's something he can do.  He ended up working his magic and upgraded us to another room and said, ""You will definitely have your microwave.""    He walked us up to the 14th floor and showed us our ""room""--a freaking two story penthouse!!  The room is absolutely gorgeous!  On the main floor, there is a kitchen with dining area, a full bathroom, 2 flat screen tvs and a living room area.  Just outside the room, there is a private terrace with a jacuzzi and direct access to one of the pools.  Upstairs, there is a king size bed, full bath, and a projection screen tv that can be hidden in the ceiling.  Oh and we can't forget...we had our microwave!  :)  I do have a complaint though--I guess housekeeping didn't clean our room well enough because there was broken glass in our bathroom!  Unfortunately, I ended up stepping in it and cutting my foot and also my finger.  :(  I ended up filing a report...hopefully, that message will be relayed to housekeeping so they know to not rush during cleaning.  If this were a regular room, I'd probably do more than just file a complaint.  But, since the room was more than I could have imagined, I quickly forgot about my bleeding foot."
8562,train,1,"We have been to Vegas a dozen times so we scheduled this tour simply to be able to see the lights and excitement of the strip from the open top deck of the bus. We had no idea that we were going to get a Vegas history lesson as well as hear interesting facts about the various properties etc. Our tour guide, Ernesto, was very friendly as well as funny. The only thing I would change was he did speak a little too much in Spanish, BUT the tour bus did have 3 groups of folks that spoke it so it made sense. I would just have preferred to be in on the jokes too. Other than that, I thought the tour was fabulous, and I would recommend it to anyone. Already planning my next Vegas trip with some folks that didn't go this time and this tour is definitely on my must do list."
2512,train,1,Old school vibe in the casino.  Dealers are friendly and waitresses are quick with the cocktails no matter where you are playing.  Came over the weekend for a concert and was hoping to get a seat on the Patio Bar.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got there that they were reserving a limited number of spots.  It was awesome! Kris and CJ kept it hopping all night bringing drinks from Ferdinand and the boys!!  It was a party atmosphere and the whole place felt like we all were old friends!! This definitely is a place to stop and have a drink when downtown!!
2219,train,-1,"Stayed here for a second time. First experience was fine. The hotel is clearly old and in a bit of disrepair. Rooms were not clean. Traveled with two co-workers. One's sheets were clearly not cleaned between guests, the other person's room had urine on the floor in the bathroom. The front desk didn't provide solutions but comped their stay. My room was better, but certainly not to the cleanliness level of other Holiday Inns. There are many hotels in the area, so I'd suggest trying another place. This one has staffing issues."
9265,train,1,"the main reason i'm giving this hotel 5 stars is because they are dog friendly.  and finding a dog friendly hotel in metro toronto was, i found, very, very difficult.  (i have a 20-month-old belgian shepherd...)  i was in toronto for 3 days for the juno awards.  when i was looking for a dog-friendly hotel, i phoned around to over a dozen hotels only to be told that they are not pet-friendly.  i stayed at this hotel before and, because of its location and the good quality of the rooms, i though there was no way in hell that this hotel would take a dog.  this was the last hotel i called and to my surprise, they told me they did take dogs with a $50 fee per day.  i made the reservation on orbitz (surprisingly for less than $100/nite) and just made note of who i spoke to at the hotel that dogs were accepted.    when i got to the hotel, parking was a bit of a challenge.  there was some sort of function going on that weekend and the parking lot was full for most of the weekend, so it took about 5 minutes or so of driving around until someone pulled out.  the lobby was clean and spacious, the staff was very courteous, even taking an interest in my dog.    my room was very, very spacious and very clean.  i got a corner room with a long hallway (which my dog liked to run up and down with a tennis ball), two queen size beds, and a very large bathroom.  a copy of the ""toronto star"" newspaper showed up at my door every morning.  i hope this hotel remains a pet-friendly hotel.  should the occasion come again when i am in toronto again (during non-camping season), i will make this my hotel of choice."
6622,test,1,"Great place, always a chic and fun place. I like the marquee night club and the hidden pizza. So many beautiful faces running around here, definitely a great place to visit if you're young and looking for fun."
9257,train,-1,"Lousy hotel, especially for the ""regular"" rate. It only gets two stars from me because when my bf and I stayed there for Anime North, we got the 20% off discount for staying three or more nights. At $100 a night it's actually sort of approaching a remotely acceptable super-budget hotel (except not, because the simple Best Western at its normal rate at that price blows this place out of the water), but absolutely NOT at $120 plus tax. Well, this hotel is NOT worth it. The rooms are awful. Here's my bulleted list.  -ONE working outlet, maybe two, per room because all the others had power cords or extension cords in them or were loose/broken.  -Our single overhead light (other light being two extremely dull lamps) broke halfway through our stay, and did I mention that first lightswitch you'll encounter doesn't do anything?  -Furniture is worn down and beat to hell- scratches all over the coffee table, old lampshades, faded chairs, bargain-sale desk chair, etc.  -Good god, that fake-brick wall is HIDEOUS, especially with green furniture.  -No mini fridge despite asking for one. There was a keurig, but I don't drink that crap and so never used it. The ice bucket was TINY. You could maybe put a can of pop in it. -No concierge selling anything but junk food and tacky souvenirs and no breakfast that wasn't an overpriced cold continental thing. Which made breakfasting difficult. We bring our own stuff and eat in our room at conventions to save time and money. HOWEVER- no fridge for milk or to chill our juice boxes, and no concierge with any that wasn't a twenty-minute walk away? Great. Dry cereal and room temperature juice for breakfast with doughnuts that went inexplicably stale in just a day... Likewise, needed to grab some batteries. Nothing even remotely fancy! Just AAs. Nope, no luck, they had none and wouldn't say the nearest place to get some. -The bedding is AWFUL- the pillows are small and smushy and I had a constant neckache as a result, and not REMOTELY enough bedding (ONE blanket with a duvet cover. No, not a quilt, not a duvet, a BLANKET, that looked like it came out of the army surplus, and no spare in sight in the room). In fact, I also don't think my sheets were actually clean either, because I found hot pink stains near the bottom of the bed and I don't know HOW they could have gotten there from me.  -The bathrooms are also rundown- grungy ceilings, cracks all over the floor tiles, extremely narrow bathtub, a ""penis-eating toilet"" according to my bf (the lid does NOT stay up), and sorely lacking in amenities (watered-down shampoo/body wash bolted to the wall, same with the conditioner, one bar of hand soap, barely enough towels, nothing else like lotion or a shower cap that even budget hotels usually have). And a LOUD fan that can't be turned off. -Worst of all, the wi-fi. Almost nonexistent! At night, you will get NO signal. During the morning/day you'll be lucky to connect for ten consecutive minutes.  We didn't bother with the pool, going over to our friends hotels to swim/tub with them, but I heard several people saying that their pool area was a freezing cold joke at best. The only good points? Elevators are fast and weirdly cheery and the bus stop is literally steps from it. I will NOT EVER stay here again. Book the Courtyard Marriot for LESS on a non-peak/sleazily-jacked-up-rate night (that rant involving hotels is a whole other thing) and it's worlds better for the same price. :P"
842,train,0,"It's a spot to rest your head.  Outside doesn't look promising, but the inside of the rooms were clean.  Every person I delt with was personable and professional.  They even smiled and joked around some...  The guy next to me said that his AC smelled like a dirty fish tank when he turned the AC on...  Checked mine and it did too.  So maintenance has some AC cleaning to do....  I will go back again,  just hope that the dirty fish tank smell is remedied.   I will want the AC on the next visit."
9167,test,1,"My second stay in the Cleveland area is much nicer than the first.  First stay was at a Hilton Doubletree and it was huge disappointment.  Hampton was much cleaner and free breakfast was included.  Room was brighter and bigger.  Bath was bigger and everything worked.  very clean. Better TV choices.  weekday appetizers in the lobby free after 6 was great, got to try local food w/o having to leave the hotel.  GReat idea!  Front desk clerk was friendly, helpful, and real. Great location near great variety of restaurants.  Highly recommend over Hilton Doubletree."
1093,train,-1,"We were seated quickly & the atmosphere is wide open. The tables are right by all the traffic in the casino. We ordered a beer & then realized you can do buckets, so we asked if we could just do a bucket and of course that was a big deal. We couldn't add on to our previous purchase. The food was alright but definitely not worth the price. We had two beers each, and we both got sandwiches  with a small sack of chips and all together it was $95! It's convenient when you're staying at the hotel, but you're better off going to the buffet!"
9905,train,1,"ALMOST everything was perfect. We extended our stay from 4 days to 7 days because we were comfortable enough and I got sick, so we wanted to hang in the area instead of continuing our long road trip. The layout of the rooms are FANTASTIC. Enough space on the table for both my husband and I to set up our laptops, and there are 2 chairs, too.   We used the kitchenette and saved money on food while here.   The only problem with this room is there is some kind of odor that hits you right when you walk in the room. You get used to it after about 2 minutes, but we've tried opening the window and we bought our own air freshener stuff. The window only opens 6 inches, and the A/C does not have a great ventilation system. The smell is not smoke. It's like cleaning product that's gotten stuck in the carpet over the years. I think the curtains and carpet are too old and need to be removed.   That being said, for the value, it's great. Also, I loved that the cleaning people don't come daily. I don't have daily cleaning at home and I don't need it here. The free laundry also helps us - we've been on a long road trip.  We didn't try the pool or jacuzzi. I saw lots of kids at the pool, so it must be fine."
9471,train,1,Great friendly service and staff. Wonderful Corner view of downtown towards the Cleveland Browns Stadium and the Erie Lake. The restaurant breakfast buffet is def the way to go. The food is excellent. Great location for getting around the city driving or by taxi. The Marriott @ Key Center is where I will be staying next time I am in Cleveland. Can't wait for the new casino finally finished being built. This hotel close to all the hot spots.
9528,train,1,"Stayed on the 3rd floor during our honeymoon. The service was all around exquisite, very detail oriented and catered to our every need. Concierge took care of everything from reservations to helping is locate lost luggage and bringing it to us at the airport. The included breakfast is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had and the entire restaurant/bar is lovely. 10/10"
5762,train,1,"With Vegas being perhaps the trendiest city, this is probably the hottest hotel right now.  I say right now, because who knows what the next place would be.  Had the city room on the 30th floor with a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.   The room is a bigger than your average hotel room.  The bathroom is nice and spacious and has all the modern amenities.  The thing that annoyed me about this place was you had to use your room key to get to a floor and didn't always work on the first try.  The hotel has the hottest club Marquee, nice restaurants, and a locals' gem, a pizza joint right next to Blue Ribbon on the third floor.  Service staff was good, thought it could be better, but the good thing is, didn't have to use them much.  Keep in mind, this place is a Marriott chain, so they will price match and take another 25% off of the bill.  Long as they're not losing money, I'm sure Marriott will keep that in effect.  It does take 24hrs Marriott to process the price match."
237,train,0,"Stayed here For four days and my experience was up and down, I will break it down in sections.   The hotel: I honestly was like ""oh God"" when I first drove up because the hotel didn't look that great from the outside but later realized they are doing work on the hotel and that's why it looked that way. The stairway hallway smelled really bad but hallway were the rooms are was fine. The lobby was nice.   Rooms: I had a King room, room was small but suitable for my boyfriend and I. If you have a big family I wouldn't recommend it because it could get crowned. I bed was...AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Like seriously, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud, I did not want to wake up in the morning! The room was clean, smelled nice, decent TV and really good cable selection. The room by itself gets 4 stars easy.   Staff: Now that staff is were it gets tricky. The ladies at the front desk are great, they were very nice and answered any questions that I had. My sink in the bathroom wasn't draining water and the women at the front desk had the maintenance guy come right up to fix it with my problem! The African American cleaning lady that I was down stairs helping with breakfast and cleaning the windows was REALLY NICE. She always said have a bless day and was very sweet. BUT whoever cleaned my room was a hot mess. When I came back from work they had threw my clothes that were on the bed on the floor and I had a shirt hanging up in the bathroom and they threw that on the floor too and left it there. I thought it was very rude for them to touch my stuff and leave it on the floor! I was not happy about this and just kept a ""do not disturbed"" sign on the door until I checked out because I didn't want them in my room after that.  Location: I feel like people who say how bad this location is are expecting way too much! I use to work in this area and though it is not the nicest area in charlotte, I always feel safe. And they people here were nice. I opened the door for a resident there once because he's hands were full and after that every time I saw him he opened the door for me..so sweet.   Anything else: Breakfast is standard. Waffle machine needs to be upgraded, waffles don't get crunchy. I would stay here again if need be...especially to get to that bed again...it was amazing!  But someone needs to have a chat with the cleaning ladies because throwing someone's stuff on the floor is rude!"
9054,train,-1,"You really do get what you pay for. The hotel is on the first floor, up a flight of stairs that might as well be leading to a hidden sweat-shop. At the top there is an imposing looking door with one of those fire-proof glass panes. When we reached, the door was locked. There was a sign on the door listing the owners phone number, and asked onlookers to give him a call.  The owner greeted us in a few minutes. I think we woke him up. He was surprisingly nice, and his presence was a stark contrast to the gloomy curroundings. The walls were clean, but unadorned. There was really nothing there in the main hallway except for an unassuming counter-top.   Now, what most people may not know is that Jun Jun also rents rooms by the hour (i believe the minimum is 5 hours). We were just looking to sober up before driving back home and found this to be quite convenient. The hallways are shady, but the rooms was better than I expected. Nothing fancy, just a bedroom with an attached bathroom. The sheets, counters and toilet looked clean and well taken care of. However, the room reeked of left-over smoke of weed, the kind that is impossible to get rid of. Thankfully, the bedding smelled like laundry, else we would have left. There was a TV in our room, and it did have cable. But the remote was dead, leaving us to change channels the old fashion way. There was only one light in our room, which if extinguised painted room in literally pitch-black; like locked in a box black. The room also featured a small window hidden in a corner. It came complete with blinds, and one to open and close it with minimal manual labour. However, these advanced window facilities were seldom used because there was nothing to see outside, and no outside light to speak of.   All in all, I think my experience was satisfactory. I think it was the calm attitude of the owner that makes Jun Jun feel like a more comfortable hotel than it actually is."
9824,train,1,"This is the resort course for the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs Hilton.    Not an easy trek by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless a playable course for virtually anyone.  Desert golf is great in that low-index golfers can be challenged by the requirement to play target golf.  High handicap or newer golfers should enjoy the fact that the desert conditions make it very easy to find errantly hit balls and place them back in the fairway.  (Don't try to hit off the desert dirt unless you hate your clubs.)  There are a couple difficult forced carries but as long as you pick the correct tee box, they are all manageable.  Course conditions are always immaculate.  (I've probably played here 20 times over the past 5 years.)  The greens fees are a little on the high side, but then again this is resort golf and that is to be expected.  My only complaint is the service.  The guys who work the carts need to grow up and act a little more mature.  I get tired of standing there watching towel fights or two guys arguing over who can hit a golf ball farther.  I don't know why, but this seems to have gotten worse in the past year."
9182,train,1,"My GF and I stayed here recently for training for work. Upon arrival, we opted to park our rental ourselves. Checking in was fast and painless with Michael's assistance. We had help from the bellboy to drive us to our car with the golf cart and transport our luggage to our room. Without his help, I'm pretty sure we would have wondered around aimlessly due to the immense size of this resort.   Now more about our room. The bed was extremely comfortable. One of the best I've ever slept in. The restroom was huge! By far the biggest sink counter top we've had at any hotels. Which is definitely a plus for GF and I. The walk-in shower was a cool addition. The view from our bed/balcony was breath taking due to The Camelback Mountains. Despite all the nice things we noticed, we had a little hick-up during our first couple of hours of stay, but the hotel was kind enough to compensate us and upgraded our room for us. There was an issue with the AC so we can only imagine how hot it was inside our room. Michael was on top of things and sent a bellboy to help relocate us to the next room.   We hardly stayed in our room during our stay since we were always out, but room service was perfect. Everything was put back the way it was. Our bed was made. Dirty towels were exchanged for new ones.   I needed some paperwork faxed and Allison at the front desk was very helpful.   During our stay, there were not any kids running around so the place was pretty quiet. Even the pool area seemed dead. However, I can only imagine this place when it is at its' peak season. Overall, the resort is beautiful. Top notch and world class service from the staff. I highly recommend you to stay here whether you are one of the locals needing a place for a stay-cation or a businessman or woman from out of town."
7931,train,0,"Average hotel on the strip. Good restaurants. Casino section is small. Will only stay here again if there's a good deal, otherwise stay elsewhere. There are better hotels on the strip with room rates approximately similar to cosmopolitan."
2802,train,1,"This place is cheap, the rooms are huge, with a fridge and microwave. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. Free WiFi too! The bathroom is nice and the pool and hot tub are lovely. The hallways are a little scary, but I still haven't fully recovered from The Shining, so I may be a tad sensitive to this.  The neighborhood is somewhat questionable, but the parking lot has security cameras in it, and there are some amazing Asian food restaurants down the street. The owners don't want you to muck up their hotel, and they make that clear, but I can respect that. They're doing a good job running their family business and I wish this place luck!"
7640,train,1,"I finally had the opportunity to stay at The Cosmo this weekend, and let me just say I was absolutely floored with the staff & suite! Everyone was extremely sweet & helpful. The suite was incredible! Very spacious, very well lite and decorated. I high recommend this hotel. It's by far my favorite place to stay in Vegas now!"
7717,train,1,"Its all in the name-- The Cosmopolitan.  Formerly a hotel-condo, the property was properly designed for various levels of entertainment.  However, what about a casino?  The casino floor is very tiny compared to many big, corporate resorts on the strip.  It does have a high limit area incorporated on the casino floor-- a handful of tables and slot machines.  The area does get lost among the rest of the casino, for obvious reasons being the size, and does not exactly seem too fancy.  The most horrible part, they took so much money opening night.  Incentives to come back?  Though the resort does entice you to look closer at the enormous Swarovski crystal chandelier, why get any closer to the tables if you exhausted your marker to the last penny.  Wrong move, Cosmo. Wrong move.    As for the room.  I stayed on the 62nd floor in a 1200 square foot suite, with a wrap around porch.  From the full size Miele equipped kitchen, to the million thread count beddings, the suite was surely one to impress. The wrap around porch does raise some concerns for the rowdy, avid, gambler/drinker.  One stupid move, and your stay at the Cosmopolitan could cost you more than that crystal chandelier.    In a nutshell, the Cosmopolitan does its definition justice-- very sophisticated.  Great food.  Great staff.  Great property.  But like all resorts, there are some things to work on."
7332,train,1,"Chic, elegant, trendy. I'd say it's Las Vegas' swankiest hotel at the moment. The place is absolutely beautiful. The decor itself has personality, and the chandelier in the middle of casino is so fascinating, it'll have you in awe of this place. I came here with a large group of about 20 to celebrate my friend Mark's birthday. I've been here a handful of times before, but this was the first time I've actually stayed here. I was staying in the ""City Room,"" and Mark and a few others were staying in the baller status room AKA the ""Wrap-Around Terrace."" We all were able to get rooms on the same floor, so it was decided that Mark's room was deemed ""The Party Room,"" and every other room was for sleeping.  The City Room was your standard hotel room with that eclectic Cosmo touch. Our room had 2 double beds and a see-through window to the shower/bathroom from the living room. Strange, right? Now, here come the problems... When we first walked in, it was like somebody was already staying in our room except without any baggage. There was a room service tray that wasn't cleaned up - Strike 1. There was an opened soap along with its' wrapper in the shower - Strike 2. & here comes the biggie... PANTIES behind a treasure chest! Strike 3! Although the panties were hidden behind something, it's definitely not a good thing when the next guest finds them. Of course we had to say something. We demanded for the room to be re-cleaned and for some sort of compensation. I was hoping the get the room for free, but they gave us $150 hotel credit instead. That works, I guess.  The Wrap Around Suite was AMAZING. It was essentially an apartment with an astonishing view from the 40th floor. We had the view of the entire strip with the Eiffel Tower to our right and the Bellagio fountains right below us. It was spacious with 1 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, a living room, kitchen with bar, and a balcony that wraps around a corner of the hotel. By far, this is the best view I've ever seen of the strip. Like I said, this was dubbed ""The Party Room."" So of course music was blasting 24/7, people were going in and out, and we were getting crazy up in here. Security came up on Saturday before we headed out to Marquee and told us we had to leave the room. They said they heard our music all the way from the elevators. Damn, we were all the way at the end of the hall too. Whoops. They thought we were throwing a huge rager in the room, but we were just pre-partying.  No biggie though, they were cool, and they didn't kick us out of the hotel.   Despite the incident that happened in my room, I still love the Cosmo. I can't get over how sick this place is. It's super girly, and maybe that's why I love it. I tried out some great eats here too... check out Wicked Spoon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wicked-spoon-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:Jps3nLDe0W6_wNvLs3JIrg), Scarpetta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/scarpetta-las-vegas#hrid:K47i9I9IPkPwfE6I9gcAUA), and Secret Pizza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/secret-pizza-las-vegas#hrid:Yv872HM_ELzIUnqvWjeGFQ)."
8513,test,1,"We were on our way back to Texas at the end of our California road trip and my wife got hit by the flu... big time.  So we looked online and found this hotel.  I am so glad that we did.  Everybody at this hotel was amazing, they wanted to help, tried to find opportunities to do so, and then did it.  I have stayed at 5-star resorts that didn't have service that comes even close to what the folks at this hotel did.   They don't technically have a bell service, but James is right there to help you with bags.  Ian is behind the desk with bottled water.  They are all right there.    I really felt like I was staying with family.    I did have one issue with the hotel keys getting demagnetized.  They kept helping me out.  They even checked on how my wife was doing each time I came by.     If you happen to be travelling through the Phoenix area and need a place to stay, check this place out.  They are superstars."
4230,train,1,My wife and I have been to a half-dozen of these types of shows in Las Vegas and this is by far the best. The theater is medium-sized. There are major advantages to buying VIP as some of the scenes are below eye level for those in the back.  The dancing was excellent and the scenes were all awesome. Note that this is a true topless show. There are no pasties.   The pole dancing and a certain other scene were especially erotic. There is also some audience participation. Jennifer Romas talks to the crowd after the show and the girls are waiting by the exit.   Drink prices were reasonable. A call and import beer were $18. We've been to this type of show where drinks are $16 each.
8830,train,1,I have never worked with such a highly professional group of people before in my life. The owners Bill & Sarah took a personal interest in setting up the event and ensured that everything was taken care of. Shannon personally oversaw every tiny detail and was instrumental in finding vendors for every detail. Excellent people and excellent service.
1629,train,1,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for 4 nights.  If you didn't know Cosmo is part of the Marriott family, so I used some of my Marriott reward points for our stay.  There was a special checkin line for Marriott guests.  At checkin the guy was super friendly and was looking to find the best possibly room for my stay.  We ended up having a King Terrance Suite with the Japanese Soaking Tub facing the Bellagio fountains.  The view is definitely worth the price!  After I checked in, about an hour later, there was a knock at my door and they sent me a plate of cookies and 2 glasses of milk to welcome me!  I was impressed.  We had a decent sized patio over looking the fountains.  That was my favorite part of the trip.  We sat there for hours watching the fountains and people watching.  MUST MUST MUST!!  You can control the lights/A/C thru the TV.  Loved that technology.  The TVs were nice - beds were super comfortable.  Did not hear anyone from the other rooms or even outside for that matter.    Bathrooms were amazing.  I was a bit surprised at first to see you could totally view the person in the shower from the bedroom - they do have blinds though for any self conscience people.  Our room also featured a Japanese Soaking tub.  We definitely used that each night.  It was so nice to relax in the tub and watch the fountains from the tub (window to view from the tub area!).    Beware, the mini fridge and snacks are all electornically sensored, so if you move anything for more than 45 seconds you will be charged for it on your bill.  HOwever, if you accidently move something and get charged, hotel will easily refund it off of your bill at checkout.  Would not recommend the hotel for casino play - not a big playing area as other casinos.  I think their main focus is the hotel, restaurants, bars, and clubs.    One big feature that we liked is that the hotel is centrally located so you could easily walk to any nearby casinos.  Checkout process was a breeze.  Definitely will be back and fully recommend."
6122,train,1,"Beautiful hotel, beautiful suites. We had a view over the Bellagio's fountains and got to watch the light shows all evening! It was beautiful. The rooms were clean and spacious, the upgrade to the suite was so decadent! It had so much space and little luxurious nuances. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The only goofy thing was the hotel decorations: its decorated for women who read cosmopolitan magazine. It has enormous High heeled shoes decorating the lobby and everything is hot pink and black...I liked it, but I'm quite girl...My beau remarked how the whole hotel looks like it is for a bachelorette party. Cold casino as well...."
9004,train,0,"Desert Paradise is nice enough, but it seems like false advertising to call it a ""Resort.""  Resorts have bars and restaurants;  this place has neither.  It's really more like a condo complex.  However, it is clean, and it's situated in a quiet, non-sketchy area a couple of miles from the strip.  There are a few things of interest within walking distance: Walgreens, 7-11, Robertos taco shop, and a great breakfast place called The Daily Egg.  There is a nice park a couple of blocks away as well.  Rooms at Desert Paradise are spacious.  We had a 2-bedroom condo for 3 people, and there was plenty of room for all of us.  Three TVs for three people is great when you want a little down time.  Rooms come with a small patio, well-equipped kitchen, and a laundry room.  The only thing I disliked was the master bathroom.  The lighting was extremely dim.  The large shower/tub creaked like crazy whenever I stepped into it.  It gave me quite a complex!  I thought the entire thing might give way underneath me.  We came to Desert Paradise in order to use up some of our dreaded timeshare points.  If I had the money to spend, I'd much rather stay at a hotel on the Strip."
3667,train,1,"3.5 stars. Solid acts, good choreography, fun show. The ladies are all attractive, great performers, and hold your interest throughout the show.   BUT. here's the thing - when a show clearly puts itself in a particular genre and targets that type of attention and appeal, it is going to be judged on more than talent. And here are the missing 1.5 stars. The ladies are all in great shape with nice figures, but all but 1 or 2 appear to be in their 40s or more (the prettiest was easily the French maid girl, and she also has the best assets ;) ). Don't get me wrong, women can be sexy (or sexxy) at any age. But watching a lady approaching middle age jiggling her boobs on stage as a Vegas showgirl makes for less than 5 stars. It's almost like watching your mom's friends strip.  Finally, as the producer and choreographer, Jennifer Romas is featured prominently in the show. She is clearly a talented dancer and put together a great show. But, again, this is a specific type of show that rides on a specific type of appeal - and Jennifer is by far the least attractive of the ladies.   This could easily be a 5 star show - keep everything the same, but recruit 3 or 4 new up and coming girls who are/look to be in their 20s/early 30s. Done."
5355,train,1,"Oh, the Hooters casino!  How hard did I laugh when I heard that the old San Remo was being renovated into a giant boobfest?  Oh, I laughed pretty hard.  Now, let's get this out of the way to begin with:  The whole idea of Hooters is pretty offensive to my sensibilities to begin with.  My expectations were pretty freakin' low when I got pulled in there behind 2 of my more machoesque male friends.  I was strangely nicely surprised.  Yes, there are Hooters girls everywhere and I could do without the little orange shorts.  It's also really, really bright in there thanks to the amount of orange everywhere.  It's just a really orange place; aptly enough, the club there is called Orange as well although it would probably take roofies to get me in that place.  However, it had 3 things that I really liked:  1) The martini bar.  It was great!  The atmosphere isn't the exact thing I always go for, but I felt comfortable there.  Happily enough I discovered a college friend was the manager so I got some free libations.  2)  The pool!  It was February and we made our way out to the pool just because and to our delight found a fire pit set back from the deck with seating around it.  It was delightful!  3)  There was a bar inside with dueling pianos.  Not as impressive as the ones at the NY, NY but less crowded and with less expensive drinks.  The non-Hooters amenities of this place were impressively impressive."
8787,train,-1,"Kinda pricey for what you get and the on site ""restaurant"" stops serving food whenever business slows down, so don't count on a meal. Oh, and the bar serves beer but not wine, not sure about liquor. No movie channel on the TV. Pool was pretty and staff was friendly.   If not for the night desk clerk, we wouldn't have eaten that night. We initially thought the Italian place she recommended that delivered was also pricey. When our order (a good-sized one) was delivered in less time than we had been told to expect, we decided that the timeliness, appearance, flavor and amount we received was not bad. Especially when ordering after 9 pm."
6627,train,-1,"Fact:  Stayed in this hotel in 2012 and just recently in 2013  This place is owned by a bank and acts like it. Its all glamor show...I mean ""SHOW"" and its very attractive to those who are very ""shallow"" with money to burn.    IF you gamble good luck....you have better shot going to Caesars or anywhere else.   IF you like to buy $20 Hamburger or $45 steaks that taste worse than Wendy's or sizzler this is the place.  some facts based on my stay in the hotel room:  The Rooms:  1. CLEANLINESS- The room are not that kept up 2. THIN WALLS  (thin cheap drywall) Don't be alarmed but there is a good chance at finding writing on the walls 3.TOILET - sometimes flushes fully sometime only 1/2 you really have push the lever down 4. No thought must have gone on when putting a safety lock box with a sliding door to bathroom because if you close that slider and not using the lock box the box door will swing open and almost  LOCK YOU in the bathroom. 5. They do have a good view of another hotels watershow...but it gets old quick and those thin walls you will hear EVERY blast they make. 6. Pillows are soft...I thought they might be made from helium 7. Bed casing cheeeeeeaap and dirty....but I found 15 cents from noticing how dirty they were...   The TV (when you have dull time between conference meetings this is important)  1.  TV's was scratched which made watching annoying (thought it was only one time thing....low and behold the second time I stayed it had scratches too) 2.  PIX ELATION VIEWING that is what you will see when watching TV here - NO HDTV at all. 3.  When using this funky TV REMOTE they give you - you must point directly at one part of the TV otherwise forget it. 4.  TV CLOCK (it thinks your in another timezone) is an hour off which makes the ""TV Guide"" useless 5.- CHANNEL LAG - ANY channel you wish to watch takes 2-4 minutes before it appears (it does get better in the afternoon), so if you like channel hopping grab snickers as it will take a awhile. 6- MENU SYSTEM - The menu system on the TV which is important for other than watching its awful and after you do a check out it will just sit there....then you do it again...again...and finally it will acknowledge you.   Features of the room:  1. ooooh the LIGHTING....hello/ goodbye seem the only choices here - its not easy to set lights and made difficult by placing the master switch at the door. (hard to explain this system but expect frustration here) 2. in 2012 room came with a high tech PHONE which handled most everything which helped with operating the lights from the bed.....BUT in 2013 they must have went REAL CHEAP and got some ill advised cordless cheap phone cause none of the shortcut buttons work essentially just hit 0 cause everything else will be a chore. 3 The FURNITURE-  It seems Deutsch Bank (owners of Cosmopolitan) got all the hotel room furniture at a low cost thrift center but must hired someone to attempt to make it look ""cool"" 4. ICE ICE BABY -- good luck  they have one ice machine per floor (fine!) but they give you a microscopic ice bucket, so you have either make many trips or take the liner out of the garbage can and use that one to get ice. 5. NICKEL AND DIME you with food tray and filled refrigerator with high priced stock....it would have been nicer to remove all that and let the customer use the fridge for other things...plus be careful open it that fridge and its $9-12 charge just to look whats inside it. 6. ELEVATORS so many sets of elevators you must pay attention to which set is going to your room....also just recently the elevator buttons get stuck...meaning the elevators will skip your floor and you could wait awhile before someone fixes it...even if they already know there is a problem  (how could this be because EMPLOYEES have their own elevator they take)    ambiance 1. it looks like they re-purposed a bunch of old photos of old Vegas to make it hip 2. They must have take art work from local middle school odd design classes...and placed it around floor 2 and 3  (although 5 dogs staring at each other got more interesting as time went on) 3. Chandeliers  are plastic....not a total surprise really. 4. Lots of woman with short dresses  (plus in my book but its really gold diggers looking for some c-notes) 5. Pools are weird and ok....hardly see them used as a pool situation though gym is good   Customer Service  Expect lousy to ok....thats it...  look to see how they are pushy to get tips from you.   conference rooms The set up is good here....but flimsy walls and doors that don't close right can be annoying and over time I see this place degrading.  Up-suites They have some rather large room which at first glance is pretty cool but as you really get used to it...you realize its no differently built wise than the smaller rooms...noise is ALWAYS present   I would NOT recommend anyone to stay here on vacation - as I was here for a conference twice...I would avoid that conference if they have it at this hotel again...."
3914,train,-1,One of the most disgusting hotels i've ever stayed in. The location is good though.
3486,train,1,"Amazing views from each hotel room! This a great location for couples, friends or families looking to get away in Fountain Hills. The restaurant is definitely a great touch in addition to the other hotel amenities. The pool is great for relaxing in the sun or to enjoy the jacuzzi at night. I was not able to schedule an appointment for the spa because of my own busy schedule, but I was able to tour it. When I come back to visit next time I will definitely partake!"
2208,train,1,"We LOVED our stay at Hospitality Suites.  We found a great deal online the night before we stayed ($98 for two nights, reduced by 25%), so we jumped. It may not be the fanciest of hotels, but for the price, it definitely met and exceeded our needs. The best parts:  -Cocktail hour. Go the bar, get two free drinks (the bartenders claim to make over 200 types), sip by the pool, and repeat as often as you can handle from 5 - 6:30. You may even make friends with a jovial retiree or two.   -Breakfast. Oh my god, go to breakfast. It's not buffet, but the eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/toast plate will make you happy. You can also choose from an assortment of other dishes, including pancakes, cold cereal, danishes, etc. Did I mention that this is FREE, also?   -Saguaros growing poolside. Okay, we really love cacti.  -The bar around the corner. Technically, it's housed within the hotel walls. Cheap, yummy food, and great, down-to-earth people.  The only small problem we encountered was constant malfunctioning of our hotel key cards, but the staff was so nice and understanding every time we came in to have them re-magnetized.   We had such a great time that we opted to stay another night. We found another good deal online, and we didn't have to change rooms. We checked out, re-checked in, and that was that.  We'll definitely be back. -B"
6729,train,-1,Ahhhh scary not fan a rough crowds but dinning is worth a try!
3305,train,1,"The hotel was one beautiful. Felt almost like a botique hotel. Every corner you turned had an amazing design feature. Had a two bed room was dissapointed there was not a tub only shower. Also this room did not have a blow dryer. The time it took for staff to get us one was a little longer than usual. I would not reccommend this hotel for shopping. Very few stores,however, had a great restuarant selection."
2841,train,-1,"Uhm... I'm not even sure what to say about this place. It was uhm interesting. Friends are staying here for the week, and their room smelled gross. They basically had to constantly keep their door/window open to let the room air out. The hall smelled like urine. The rooms itself looks a little outdated, but the beds were comfy so i guess thats one positive thing. I personally wouldn't stay here. Ever. I'm really not that picky, this place just sucks. Yeah, sure, hooters rooms are cheap, but you get what you pay for... I guess if you intend on staying here, come here with an open mind, or shit-faced so you can't remember how shitty your room was haha. After all, thats the point of coming to Vegas, right?"
7799,train,1,"I have been so spoiled. Let me preface this by saying the only reason I could afford to stay here was scoring a killer deal with Marriott's ""Look no further gurantee"". It ended up being cheaper than the Monte Carlo.  Fom the moment I checked in until I got in the cab to go home, the service here was impeccable. Every single staff member was incredibly nice. The hotel is gorgeous, had everything I needed for amenities, and the shops & restaurants are very well curated to serve upscale but younger clientele. I think it's a good fit for the post-college, young professional, not-The Hangover-wannabe crowd. (of course, the nightclub & pool party kids are a difference scene. I wouldn't judge the hotel based on that.) I could've stayed in the resort the entire time and would've been perfectly happy.  You can find tons of information about the cool rooms, so I won't get into that. But everyone mentions the peek-a-boo shower and forgets to add that there are optional blinds to cover it up. I want to point that out just in case you are going with friends and are nervous about that. My room was on the ""57th"" floor (does this hotel really have 75 stories?) and I didn't have any problems with the elevator that other people mentioned.   Everything was perfect. Quick tips: 1) Use the Marriott ""Look No Further"" guarantee if you can. 2) Sign up for the Identity membership because for every $100 you spend in the hotel, you earn $5 back. Plus there are sign-up bonuses. I got a $15 zappos gc!"
5751,train,-1,"We are so done with this place! We have stayed twice in as many months and we will never return. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the rooms are amazing, the restaurants are good and Chandelier Bar is lovely. However the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. We stayed 3 nights and our room didn't get cleaned one time, despite 3 phone calls asking for it to be done. We barely got extra towels. The window sill had dead bugs in it, the bathtub wasn't super clean either. Stay at another hotel then go there for the food and bars. We are so disappointed as after our first experience we were assured this one would be better. It wasn't, might have even been worse. We will be staying elsewhere on future trips to Vegas."
1663,train,-1,"I've stayed here many, MANY times.  Last visit was pretty bad from misrepresentation of the noise level from the construction, to the lights/electronics not properly working in the rooms.  Too many little things to mention but plan to change our loyalties to another property on our next stay. I understand that the Cosmo is having financial problems, but they aren't going to get better this way."
8581,train,0,"Not a bad stop. This location isn't exactly close to the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto, so if you're staying here it's probably for business.  Lobby was being renovated, so was quite impressed with what I found there on the ground floor. Hopefully it looks spectacular when they're done.  The rooms were clean and seemed decent enough. But the thing that bumped them down to a 3 star for me was the internet. The download and upload speeds were very frustrating, and made it difficult to get much accomplished.  Overall, not a bad stop. But it's hard to relax and unwind when the internet connectivity drives you a bit crazy"
584,train,1,"Overall great tour bus experience. However, our satisfaction level depended on which guide and driver we were assigned. My favorite guide was Ramone, he was knowledgeable, appropriately funny and could answer everyone's questions. Matt and Vanessa were also terrific. If only all of your guides could have Vanessa's energy and sweet bubbly personality. One gentleman (whose name escapes me) was somewhat knowledgeable but somewhat annoying. (I experienced him twice, once was on Wednesday 10-14-15 around 1pm). I was telling my husband more of the tidbits I learned from other tour guides than this man was sharing). Finally Lashawn was terrible. She commented that we were all tired at 4pm then proceeded to sit down and not speak through most of the strip tour. She did walk around quite a bit while and offer to take photos. Again overall this tour is worth purchasing and takes you through the strip, as well as downtown."
7458,train,1,"By far one of my favorite hotels in Vegas. Young, edgy crowd with lots to do.

Every corner has something cool to look at, like the repurposed cigarette vending machines that now dispense local artwork on the 2nd floor, interesting sculptures, and vintage black and white photos of parties past. Lastly, don't forget to check out Rose. Rabbit. Lie. with craft cocktails, dancing, several hidden rooms to explore, and cool performances (e.g., dances, raunchy comedy, trapeze) interspersed throughout the night. Also, many rooms in the hotel (if you're staying) overlook the Bellagio fountains and the patio gives you one of the best views of the Strip. This place is pricey, but well worth the experience in my opinion. Renewed my faith in Vegas and the Strip :-) Enjoy!"
4933,train,1,"So I'm probably delusional.....but I had an idea of the old school ""classy Sinatra"" Vegas---where dames and gents dressed up in suits and dresses.....and tacky & trashy only existed in back alley's----   However, my boyfriend tells me the quality of the most expensive hotels has greatly decreased over the years---but The Cosmopolitan keeps up with worldly design, nice atmosphere, and removed their cheesy carpets years ago.   I stayed in the suite on the 38th floor.......very nice. They were lacking with hand soap, shampoo, and conditioner.....but other than that..... the hotel rooms are beautiful!!!   The casino isn't that spectacular.....but the buffet at Wicked Spoon will definitely satisfy your appetite."
8463,train,1,"These are like a hybrid apartment/hotel and for the price you get a much better deal than you would at a hotel IMO.  My company suggested I stay at the Extended Stay for about $50/night.  However I've stayed there before and decided I wanted to try something different as the Extended Stay is usually small and their wi-fi is awful. This place has wi-fi that is free but also the bedroom has an actual ethernet connection.  Anyways, this place works out to $43/night, at least that was my rate for a 30 day stay.  The building is obviously older and there is a definite smell, sort of like an old persons smell, kinda bad when you come into the front hall so that's sort of a negative and gets you worried a bit, but once you get into your actual apartment that smell doesn't exist.  My apartment smelled fresh and was very clean.  I also got a pretty large place for $43/night, it consisted of two fairly good sized bedrooms, both with tvs/vcrs/dvd (really crappy old audio video equipment I might add) with one bedrom having a queen sized bed and the other having two twins.  The main bedroom has a really large picture window which is nice.  The living room has a balcony with some furniture to sit on and everything in the kitchen is there that you'll need (including dishwasher--no icemaker though).    One nice thing is if you set up your stay beforehand with the rental office when you arrive you can just go into your room as the rooms are keyless entry, you use a code to get in.  One thing of note though is you do have to press the center button on the keypad to lock your room, so be aware of that (the rental office didn't tell me that--I figured that out myself) so you don't go and leave your place unlocked.    For you tech geeks like me the ethernet is fairly fast, about 6mbps down and 1 mbps up and the wi-fi is good enough as well for even netflix.  However, one thing to note, if you have an Xbox or another tech device which you want to use with the ethernet that has no built-in browser to accept the ""terms"" of use then you will have to call the support line for the service (Madcity Broadband) to have them add your MAC address so you can utilize the ethernet.  Prepare to wait on hold for about 20 minutes.  Other things to note is they have all the other amenities of hotels, work out room, dvd rentals (which are free overnight btw) and the like so that's a plus.  And you get maid service once a week, they change your sheets, vacuum, take out your garbage and just in general tidy up a bit.  The apartments are also very quiet, you don't hear doors slamming or children running or anything (I was in an upstairs apartment so I can't vouch for people walking above you).    Now here's the main thing to note: just about everything you can think of is there for the fully furnished units.  They have toilet paper, some napkins, salt & pepper, all the little things.  About the only thing you need to bring is some dish soap (to wash the dishes--the dishwasher does have one complimentary soap module to use), your toothbrush and your clothes.  The place is much better stocked than most places which say they're fully furnished but you find yourself running to Walmart the second day you're there and spending $40 or so on the basics.    My main complaint is the quality of the tv service.  You get no HBO, no showtime and about half the channels of the 42 offered are utterly unwatchable with so much snow you might as well be using rabbit ears.  If they'd get a real service here with clear channels, and give you the option to add HBO/Showtime ala carte with some newer tvs (the tvs in the unit are from about 20 years ago, LOL) then this place would be about perfect really and I'd raise my rating to 5 stars.  In summary though this place cannot be beat by any hotel or extended stay and I'd highly recommend it for corporate travelers and anyone staying in Madison for more than a few days."
4267,train,1,"WorldMark Las Vegas - Tropicana Avenue is a really great time share. Their lobby is full of welcoming staff...even at 10pm, if your checking in that late. Quick check-in at the counter where they have you sign in, hand you room keys, and a little handy map of the property. They show you exactly where your room is on the map. Then you are directed to a separate concierge counter just a few steps away for your parking pass, shuttle schedule (to Von's and the strip), and set up your complimentary dinner/show (so many choices) and breakfast (at the presentation building). You can purchase discounted tickets ahead of time but I'm not sure how that works.  Parking was always available right in front our unit. So glad we were on the first floor in between a BBQ area and jacuzzi. Security is very visible and it's nice to know this place is concerned about your safety.  Loved our unit: high kitchen counter top with seating, dining room, hallway closet (with pillows, hangers, iron w/ board, mini vacuum, and sweeper), living room with a TV and drawers for your guests' clothes (pull down Murphy bed behind the couch), stackable washer and dryer with 2 packets of laundry detergent, elegant bathroom (bars of soap, hair dryer; with extra towels, toilet paper, and facial tissue box under the sink), and a large beautiful bed in the bedroom (TV, full length mirror, drawers, walk-in closet with hangers).  Kitchen: fully furnished with cooking utensils & measuring bowls, BBQ cooking utensils, chopping board with knives & scissors, pots/pans, dishwasher & dishwashing detergent, dish towels, coffee and tea packets with condiments and coffee filters, kitchen appliances (coffee maker, blender, stove, oven, microwave, full-size refrigerator), seasonings (garlic, rosemary, paprika, salt, and pepper), dishes/bowls/silverware/cups/wine glasses, paper towels, sponge, dishwashing liquid soap, and recycling bag. Geez...the only things we needed to bring were food and drinks.  The only problem was the outlets were awkwardly located nowhere near the furniture if you needed to charge your phone and set on the nightstand or table.   Their quaint gym is located around the corner from the concierge counter. Small towels and water dispenser are inside the gym underneath the TV; bring your own water bottle. We had an issue with the A/C but maintenance visited within minutes of notifying staff. They do have vending machines, arcade games, TV lounge, computers, little convenient store (t-shirts, purses, sunblock, etc.), ATM, bathrooms, and a pool table ($1 to play) located in the lobby.   We did attend a presentation with free breakfast...yummy French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and beverages. I'm guessing the free tickets and breakfast were only available if you attended the presentation and consultation...so be aware. The dinner/show voucher is given to you upon exiting the presentation building after your consultation.   You can call the front desk to get you a cab and they are on top of it; or you can wait for the free shuttle which is every 20 minutes to the strip. The cabs come from The Orleans and arrive within 5 minutes. Always bring cash for your cab ride; the cab driver might not know how to print a receipt for your credit card transaction or might not be able to verify the credit card transaction.  Please make sure to trade in your voucher at least 2 hours before the show at the actual dinner/show location.   The pool is where kids rule; large blue-striped beach towels are provided in the pool area. There are spas throughout the property...one was right on the other side of our building. So serene that we ended up spending a few hours just relaxing in the spa.   You can ask any of the staff in the lobby or at the presentation for tips or must-sees in Las Vegas and they are more than happy to oblige. One employee mentioned the signature Verbana drink at the Cosmopolitan hotel and casino. It was awesome!  It's the desert and we did find one little earwig crawling on our sheets...but that didn't ruin our stay. Check-out was easy: just drop off your room keys with the front desk staff and you're done.   The comforts of home just minutes away from the strip. Our first time at this wonderful place and we were already planning our next trip while driving back to OC."
7136,train,0,"Very trendy upscale modern hotel which draws a very trendy hip  crowd.  If you are looking for a quiet room, then this hotel is NOT for you.  The walls are paper thin and I could hear our neighbors music and voices even when I know they weren't being very loud.  The doors are heavy and slam shut so was woken up whenever anyone was arriving or leaving their rooms.  We were on the 42nd floor facing The Bellagio could hear all the street noise and even the fountains.  Last time I stayed at The Bellagio and faced the fountains and couldn't hear a thing.  The rooms are very comfortable and spacious.   The lighting system was confusing, the main switch turns all the lights on and off.  We could not figure out how to turn on the bedside lamp even though there was a switch for it, so we had to either have all the lights on or off and could not control them by the bed..  I would only recommend this hotel if you want to spend the money and hang out with the young trendy Vegas crowd and plan to stay up all night and party, otherwise you won't sleep."
3371,train,1,"I've still gotten the best views in this hotel. Big airy lobby now that the construction is finally gone. Clean room this time.  Love the grab and go option for food. Loved their burger. As always, awesome location and fairly friendly staff. There's room for improvement when the friendliest staff I came across was the maid."
1021,train,1,"I agree that the food is overpriced.  But this is Vegas...EVERYTHING is overpriced, yo.  The service isn't always great.  And although breakfast is served 24 hours, the regular dinner menu ends at 10:00p.

We stop here every time we visit Vegas...sometimes twice.  Letter Grade:  B -"
9056,train,-1,"BUYER BEWARE.  I was looking for a long term, fully furnished rental.  This one looked pretty good and I thought I would give it a try.  I paid for 1 week and checked out 4 days early.  The air did not work, I called and the security guy came by (a very nice man) and said to run it on Fan........  that does not cool the place down.  the remote they gave me came with no batteries.  The previous tenant was getting calls all hours of the night, every night.  The guy above me sounded like he was moving furniture until 5 am.  The woman 2 doors down was SCREAMING at her children and the children were screaming, crying.  I had some guy walking by every few minutes that I was sure I would see on America's most wanted.   The funniest thing to me was when I checked out early, they never even inquired as to why."
9563,train,0,"A nice hotel overall, but it had some small flaws that don't merit a 4 star review.  Checked in around 9:30 PM on a Sunday night and had to wait about 3-4 minutes for someone to show up at the front desk.  She was obviously frazzled, and while she was efficient in having three of us fill out and sign paperwork to check in at once, she was far from greeting us warmly.  The rooms are nice and the desk had quite a few outlets for charging, but the night stands had no outlets and the outlet behind the nightstand was full.  It would be nice to have at least one outlet since so many people use phones for alarms, etc.  Flat screen TV was nice and the beds were comfortable.  The sheet on the bed had 3 or 4 small holes in it when I turned down the bed however.  The bathroom was pretty standard fare, however on the inside of the bathroom door, there was a pretty large greasy hand print.  Again, it was a pretty decent place overall, but the little things merit 3 stars in my book."
3586,train,0,"Hotel gets 3 stars because of the price but that is it. The hotel is just old and gross. I felt like I was walking into one of those older vegas hotels. The room was gross. Got a coffee maker with no coffee or cups. Broken lamp, many light bulbs were out. Dirty mirrors and windows. You Definitely get what you pay for. I'm my case, $40 was what I paid."

6020,test,0,"First- obviously an incredible hotel, everything is top notch, no complaints there.  BUT- I had paid $50 for early check I beforehand. When I got to the hotel, room wasn't ready, no big deal. I gave my ID,CC, and also a $50 bill (not folded like a weirdo, just making it clear I was tipping her). I asked if anything was ready.  Let me point out, I come to Vegas about once a month, I always give a tip like this at check in, not ""expecting"" anything crazy, but some level of effort. Nothing is ready, no upgrade, nothing. The reason I am writing this is, I didn't even get a THANK YOU. This stuff matters to me.  Bell, Aria, Venetian, doubt this would have happened. Not the best way to start a couple days on Vegas. Oh, it was a sun-ties trip, so you know it wasn't packed."
4434,train,-1,"Booked a room online, and had to cancel (3 months in advance). When I checked my account, they charged me AGAIN instead of refunding.... This was about 10 days ago. After multiple talks with Mark, (I assume the manager) , & booking.com who was the middleman. I gave up and went to my bank so they could process my fraud claim.  Over $400 has been tied up. I had to explain to my landlord and now have late rent fees. It was a hard lesson to learn. At least my bank and Visa are dealing with the hotel now. I made this reservation before Thanksgiving, hopefully Hyatt will give me my funds by Christmas.   My favorite part was when I was told by Hyatt via booking.com ""it was just a human error"". - No urgency on their part whatsoever. Maybe if it were their money, I would have received my 2 credits faster.   Lesson Learned."
126,train,1,We haven't been to the East Liberty area in a while. It was a pleasant surprise to find this gem.  We found the staff to be pleasant and knowledgable.  The rooms are generous in size.  Everything was clean and new.  Some have complained about the valet parking situation.  I would invite them to consider the positive impact that providing jobs for local youth has on the area which has been traditionally depressed.  We will definitely return to the Hotel Indigo next time we are in Pittsburgh.  We wish them nothing but the best!
6118,test,1,"This was my first time staying at the Cosmopolitan being I live in Las Vegas, though I visit the casino quite often for drinks and food. I booked a wraparound terrace suite with fountain view for my girlfriend and I on Valentines Day, it being her birthday as well. I booked the room a few weeks in advance to avoid occupancy issues and hoped that would give me a better room location. Seeing the room online, I wanted to visit it in person before my stay which was very easy to do thanks to the concierge department. I went to visit the room about a week before my stay and it was fabulous, great view, very spacious, beautiful bathroom. The room I visited was on the 36th floor. On the day of check in I called about an early check in and they said you can come check in but it doesn't guarantee an early check in because it was a premium room, so I went and checked in early hoping the best. They ended up texting me that my room was ready at 2pm, saying my room number and floor. The room they gave me was on the 19th floor, which was not what I was expecting. So I called and they said it was because of room occupancy and they only can guarantee the room, not the floor it's on. That was okay but I wanted it to be a great view as well as a great room so when I arrived at the hotel I went and talked to the hotel check in service and they were able to put me on the 28th floor which was better. When I got to the room it was all like the one I had visited besides two things: the ashtray on the balcony wasn't emptied from the guests before which is not that big of deal but I don't smoke and thought it was a little gross and it should've been emptied, and the pillows for the couches on the balcony were laying on the floor. I was okay with these but getting woken up at 3am by construction or work trucks on the street was not okay. I wanted to leave the balcony doors open for the nice weather outside and I did so, only to be woken up later that night. I'm not sure if being on a higher floor or not would have changed that but I know it would've been worse if I was still on the 19th floor. Besides these few things our stay was very good, and the room was fantastic."
5465,train,1,Definitely a top notch place.  Terrace Suite overlooking the Bellagio fountain was amazing.  Room was large.  Balcony was awesome.  No complaints on the room at all.    Deducting one star for the pool situation.  The pools are small and get really crowded and they don't really compare to some of the mega pools at the other Vegas resorts.   Other than that I thought this place was great and I'd definitely stay again.
8754,train,1,Great Service  and friendly staff. If I ever visit to Scottsdale again... I would surely consider this place again..  !
4923,train,0,"Beatutiful hotel! Right in the middle of everything!!! Major Save on taxi $$$ Ran into a bit of a down side while here thought but I would still go back. 1. When we checked into our room, the mouth wash and lip balm was used and we had no conditioner. So make sure you check your things first. I called the front desk and they had a bag full of NEW mouth wash, lip blam and conditioner for us in no time. 2. We tried to order a movie while there but our T.V. had no option. So, we called the front desk again and asked if we were able to order a movie from our room. After calling in 3 times and two hours later, someone came up to help us. By the way, after each call, they said someone will be up in 10 mins or so... wrong.  3. On our last night there, we got locked out of our room.... what was that about. Both of our room key didn't work and so we had to give them a call again... this time, someone was up in less then 5 mins.  Besides these 3 things... I liked this hotel.  The food at Wicked Spoon was great and the staff there were really nice.  They gave us a room with the view of the Bellagio fountain and it was great. I had a great time here... minus the 3 down side. If it wasn't for the problems, I would have gave this place a 4 star. Hopefully my next stay will be better so I can give it a 4 or better."
1297,train,-1,"Most holiday inns are great and make you feel like they care. Not this one! The staff is like a group of trained fascist. They don't price match even though online pricing is reduced significantly, as if to encourage you to not bother the people that work there. When you politely explain to front desk about something to get a clear idea, they are abrasive and give you responses like ""sir, that's not how it works here"" like you're in another country. Anyway, I recommend anywhere else. I wish I could give it negative stars."
4429,train,1,"The Hotel itself is Brand new and the rooms are huge!  The customer service is great and they have eh-breakfast buffet.   Downfall, hard to access and elevators are extremely slow. Beware about occasionally sharing the elevator with drunk kids from Fahrenheit (the rooftop bar)"

Yea just meh  it's on the strip in an area which is kinda dwindling away of all the glitz and glitter which Vegas has to offer, worth a quick walk thru if your @ circus circus and heading back down to the more lively parts of the strip. Has a couple tables which are never accompanied by an employee, some slots, and a few vending type gambling games, $1 blackjack machines, video table games... not really exciting or worth spending a lengthy amount of time with all the other great places on the strip. I wouldn't go outta my way to visit.  Saw a little snack bar with cheap eats, sodas, beers...."

Everytime I come here I always sit in different spots and I am always amazed by the view. Always something different.  The pool's DJ should be given a raise because he/she plays all the jams: Lauryn Hill, JayZ, Lupe...it felt like I was in a hip hop joint but, in a bikini and in the heat! lol One time I went, there was a band playing.  And another time, they were playing The Godfather movie on the marquee!  Their food is pretty good, too; and not completely expensive.  On the weekends, they have a bbq grill that sells grilled chicken, corn, and even sliders! It's like I'm in someone's backyard the way they've set it up.  There is just so many endless things thing I could say about this pool. NEVER A DULL MOMENT!"

4503,train,-1,"On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later.   My feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility.   I'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings."
8725,train,-1,"Attended  the Scottsdale History Makers Dinner on Wednesday, April 15th.  The dinner was the worse food I have ever been served at a ""corporate event"".  The steaks were  terrible, the meat tasted very old.  WhenI asked for a container to take mine home for my dog, 6 other people at the table passed their steaks down to me, all almost untouched.  I have attended many charity events at this resort and I have never been disappointed.  In fact, I have beencoming here for so long that my daughter who is 28 had  her 13th birthday here.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."
3774,train,1,"Although the hotel has mixed reviews, I had a great stay. The room was clean and smelled good...I'm a non-smoker and am very picky about that. Everything in the room worked fine...the lights, safe, TV, etc. The bathroom was clean, sheets were clean, carpet was old, but still clean and the wireless internet access worked fine for me. Housekeeping did a great job of taking care of the rom each day. Parking was easy. Check in and check out was easy. The pool area and facilities were good too. A great experience overall and a great price as well.  This is not a high-end resort hotel and some of the expectations in many of the reviews here are a unrealistic. If you have expectations for things other than what the hotel advertises then you should consider staying somewhere else. Do the research and if you make an informed decision to stay here you'll probably be pleased with that decision."
6101,train,1,"Kinda close to perfect: the most comfortable beds in Las Vegas, great pillows (and if they aren't just right, you can call the pillow concierge). Two TVs, loads of outlets, plenty of lamps that actually light your room (other hotels, please take note!) Big, clean well equipped bathroom. Excellent blackout curtains, very quiet, very clean, not perfumy.  So why not 5 stars? Super slow check in. No coffeemaker in the room, for one. Getting dressed and going out before coffee is a drag. Also, the room was oddly not level, which is unnerving on the 18th floor. Minibar instead of a fridge, dishwasher but no dishes. And, really, not the best price on The Strip for a luxury room. That may change when they're not the hottest place to stay."

Don't stay here and gamble and expect any comps they lured me in with costly hotel rates and pretending your bill will be taken care of and after losing several thousand dollars there they still charged me full rate and when they told me I earned free comps they suddenly all disappeared.   They will play games with your mind and When I complained and asked to speak to a manager this was the response via txt msg   ""I will not be threatened by ANY guest. I am an a Executive of this Resort and made an Executive decision. Refrain from any further correspondence with me."" -Chaz   Thanks buddy no one made any threat I just didn't feel I was getting the customer service I deserved wow what a response! Very nice customer service!!   I won't be staying there ever again and in my opinion their players club is a complete scam!!! I could have paid 10x over for my room bill with what was wagered but it's ok I like Aria and Mandalay much better.   Will go back there.  Marquee is the only reason to go to Cosmo but do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else their rooms are very small and so is the casino. They have a few billion to pay off in construction costs so I doubt they can afford to take care of their players for a long time to come!  Good luck everyone.."

485,train,1,"We stayed one night over the  July 4th Holiday and we got a sweet deal for  95 dollars night, which included 2 pool side cocktails, and no resort fee, upgraded room.    The room was decorated in modern, grand scale,  beautifully appointed bathroom with snail shower with his/hers shower heads and huge tub, and a very comfortable bed which you sink into, and the pillows and sheets were heavenly.   Amenities: pool side service,  creature comforts: a mini single serve coffee maker, and luxurious robes. Just a few issues:   At check in time,  we first got there at approx 6pm, there was only one front desk gal and she was on the phone, but I felt like since we were in person and she should of at least took the time to greet us but instead we were made to wait for about 5 minutes while she wrapped up that very important call.  Secondly, the Joya spa was closed on the 4th for the holiday, so I did not have that as an option to visit.  Lastly, we decided we would walk to the Prado restaurant and where we learned a reservation was needed, and without it , an hour and half wait would be expected! So we decided to go to Houston's! (updated review on that later).   On our way back from dinner we got to see a 4th July firework show from the north side of the resort, which they had set up seating for the guest.   Overall, it was a lovely stay and we enjoyed ourselves and I think they have some growing pains to overcome, but I am glad I got a chance to experience the resort."

I was sent a text message letting me know when our rooms were ready and we went directly to our rooms.   The check-in lobby is breath taking and has large column screens that have rotating videos. We had no trouble at all booking a Cirque de soiel tickets at the concierge.  The Cosmo is not short of their fair share of eateries. On the second level you'll find a west coast favorite - egg slut, as well as a juice stand. Be sure to grab the infamous Verbana drink for the Chandelier bar, and the brunch buffet from Wicked Spoon.  We stayed in a Terrance room that overlooked the Bellagio Fountains. From our balcony we were able to view the Bellagio Fountain show as many times as we wanted and could even hear the music. My favorite part of the room would have to be the jets inside the tub of our room. I went across the street to Basin shop inside the miracle mile shops and picked myself up a few bath bombs to elevate my tub experience ;)  Would definitely recommend the Cosmo to anyone looking for prime location, amazing view of the Bellagio capitalism show, and amazing food."
2796,train,1,"Came here to stay for 5 days for my 21st birthday. We stayed in the wraparound suite. I have felt like a celebrity the entire time I've been here! It is so nice. The hotel is decorated soooo modern and hip and gives off such an exciting energy. Our room has a huuuuge balcony, a sparkly tiled walk-in shower, and a Japanese soaking tub that overlooks the strip! Not to mention a full kitchen and living room area. The marquee night club is also insane. It felt like a movie. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone! Not one bad thing about it."
5067,train,1,Thought it was a cool start to hit up Hooters to start my trip in Vegas being across at the MGM and it was a sweet time. Service was far and above great and Hooters wings are just always great.
1807,train,1,"My girl and I found Hooters Hotel & Casino last year in May 2015.  We were actually staying at another hotel but the pool area was so much fun at Hooters we chose Hooters when we went to Vegas in January 2016. We liked it a lot. It's off of the busy strip but walking distance from it. It's small. We liked that, too. It's not so huge that you get lost trying to find your room...(cough cough MGM  We liked the restaurant we ate at too. Mad Onion. The prime rib was very good, the service was always right there for us.  They even made sure the game was on a tv near us. The rooms are about average which was really all we wanted. It's Vegas and everyone knows you are barely in the room. All in all we recommend Hooters as a good value and a fun hotel."
7379,train,0,"Pet friendly, and if booked at the right time, prices are reasonable. Decor is nice but it doesn't have great, good quality furnishings like the Bellagio or the Wynn/Encore.  Customer service is poor. Requests were denied as if their policy is very strict, unlike any other vegas hotels. Request for extra blankets took over an hour, late check out was denied w/o checking the system, additional charges were on our bill for comped buffet that our package came with.  Stingy with drinks at the sports betting. They say for every $100 bet you get a drink voucher. Really?? I get free drinks watching sports w/o betting at every other hotel...   Only good thing at the cosmo is the ""secret pizza place"" Get the sausage and peppercini one. Its good!  I foresee when the hype runs out, it'll be like a planet hollywood... cheap and fun for the younger crowd."
4163,train,0,"Room service is decent, we stayed for $29.99 for a Friday night on Labor day weekend. Its old time hotel pricing like it was before. Rooms are basic, a little dated but still decent. Casino slots don't pay much. They do have a resort fee. Pool is cool, restaurant is also good. Not too far from the strip and airport. Overall great place for the price."
4095,test,-1,"This review is just for the restaurant..  Just landed from coming in from Hawaii for EDC2011. some of our friends wanted to go out that night but I was dead tired and didn't want to go anywhere except to eat and sleep.  I asked my sister who lived there for many years and suggested a place on where to eat. She said go eat At Terrible's Cake in the hotel with the same Name.. Its cheap & no frills food. The people I was with didn't like the idea of a restaurant named Terrible's so they suggested Hooters.  I was like okay that's fine, since you cant really mess it up right?  We get there and we have to sign up for some Hooters Card thingy to get the discounted chicken wings. I'm like okay cool. Then after about 20 minutes later, we are signed up and seated.  I just wanted some wings and a side to suppress this stomach cramps i have been having because of nothing to eat. The wing special they have is for some really cheap amount, i forgot how much it was, like 10 cents or 20 cent wings?  But here is the catch, you need to buy a Soda, and a minimum purchase of wings. The wording was really complicated but we had to ask the waiter and she explained it to us.  I get wings and some onion rings and a Diet coke. It comes out fairly quickly. I was hella hungry so didn't even bother to assets what i was eating. I just went chowing down.  After eating all the minimum order of the wings. We leave the restaurant. But then a little bit after, about 20 minutes or so after eating, my start to get stomach cramps again and had to use the restroom at our hotel.  Seems like I got food poisoning from the Chicken. When I think back about it. the chicken was really cold like it was sitting out side for a while already. I asked my sister about it who also works in the food service industry and she also said she got food poisoning from there.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll pass on Hooters. there is so many better places to eat.  Well there you go, if you want some chicken wings with a side of food poisoning, Hooters for cheap wings is the place you want to be."
6073,train,1,"We went for my husband's 30th birthday and I must say this was by far one of the best experinces I have ever had.  I loved the decor of the hotel, the ambiance, the food, the casino, and I loved that the waitresses kept the drinks coming when I was gambling.  The only ripoff was the Club Marquee, it was way overpriced and you could not sit down unless you got bottle service.  I could only last an hour before my feet in my 5 inch heels were screaming.  I say skip the club and hang out in the casino, the spa, and hit their buffet.  I was also able to book my husband a boxing lesson in the gym at the last minute as his birthday present, after the boxing lesson we were able to use the spa services all day at no additional charge. I am defintely going back. It was a great time at the Cosmo, no other hotels really compare."
1748,test,-1,"-- No water pressure   -- Five days there and my room was only cleaned twice, and I had to request one of those days.   -- One day there was no hot water for several hours.   -- The next day there was also a power outage for almost two hours.  -- WiFi was down overnight   -- Most of the elevators were not working and the only one that did was overworked and slow.   -- The breakfast was 'ok' but it lacked condiments such as hot sauce and salt and pepper shakers.   -- Yes the hotel is directly under the flight path of departing planes but those people  just need to get over it - airports are a fact of life.  Plus they don't land much at night, it's just the early morning when you might hear them.   -- Trust me, this hotel really needs to work on the little things that make the customer experience enjoyable and in my humble opinion they failed to seize their opportunity with me."
1496,train,-1,"Rooms are not terrible but borderline gross. Everything was a little dirty with some kind of stain. Never staying here again. Old rooms, smells like smoke everywhere and very loud. You can hear everything, including music from Fremont Street until 1 AM."
1721,train,-1,Do not become a Timeshare owner with WorldMark......they are the worst!  I've been an owner with them for 10 years and wish I could get out TODAY!  They are horrible!
9068,train,1,"I love Boulder Station!     Great (although small) Poker Room - loose players fill up my chip stacks.  Friendly dealers, helpful Floormen, organized atmosphere and a HUGE bad beat jackpot!  Good and cheap food, karaoke, table games, and hourly bingo, who could ask for more?!?!?!?"
1047,train,-1,"Service is bad, very overpriced for it's value. If it was better service I'm sure the food would've tasted slightly better. A second cup of water would be nice too."
9823,train,1,Challenging greens with unexpected slopes and fairways with tons of surprises. We played the forward tees but the championship tours looked really challenging!  Love the lunch that you call in at the 8th hole and then eat on your way to the 10th.  Not very much water on the grounds.   Overall we had a great experience and we would definitely play this course again or even bring friends to it.
6667,train,-1,"They still have a lot of kinks to work out.  When we first arrived no one was there to open the ""front"" doors. I had to phone the front desk for several issues and got incorrect information each time. The staff at the pools and casino were very unfriendly. If you are staying on a Friday or Sat night you should request the East Towers. For the money I paid I would not expect to be woken up from the partying that was taken place on the roof top bar. It was so loud it shook my tv."
5369,train,-1,"My opinion is: come for the hooter wings but avoid the hotel, it's cheap, a bit dirty, needs more upkeep. Not sure what hotel this was before it became Hooters but it's a definite fixer upper."
4675,train,-1,"This place is a joke and I will never stay here again. I made the reservation online for the rate of $55 a night. When I got there to check in the total was $172 and when I asked why I was told there was a $100 deposit (even tho I had a credit card) and the discount would be applied upon check out. It didn't make sense to me and the more I tried to understand and inquire the bigger the attitude got. The front desk staff was rude and obviously had no clue how to properly operate a hotel which was proven when I went to the room and there was already someone in it. I had to wait for the employees to figure out what was available and what wasn't. I asked for a bar of soap and was told to get it out of the vending machine. In the middle of the night I got cold and turned the heater on which set off the smoke alarm. The front desk would come to my room everytime it happened and tell me to shut it off. Who cares that I am freezing cold I guess. The next day starting at 940 the staff was calling and bugging me about checking out. I told them I would be out by 11, which is check out time and of course got major attitude. I should have been used to the crappy attitude by that time cuz that's all I got the entire time. I went to the front desk to check out and the same rude lady that checked me in (guess no one else works there which might explain the rudeness) looked at me then proceeded outside to smoke a cigarette. I waited not so patiently standing at the front desk until she came back to check out. I was reluctantly given my refund back but not the money for the rate difference. I asked her and she said that should have been handled at check in and there was nothing that could be done now. I was steaming mad and all she said was ""call corporate office if you don't like it."" Wow!! Never again!!"
2329,train,-1,"This is an old, run down hotel and casino on the wrong side of the tracks in Vegas even though it is right on Fremont Street.  Its the kind of place where everyone looks like they are down on their luck and down to their last dime.  The only reason we stayed here was because we couldn't find anything else online at 1:00 a.m. while traveling back from L.A. to Salt Lake City.  The rooms are tiny, old, and even the non-smoking rooms have absorbed the foul casino smoky smells from years of having it seep through the walls and having it tracked in by guests.  The blankets were worn and filled with cigarette burn holes.  I wouldn't stay at this hotel again even if I had the room comped to me.  You have been warned!"
6419,train,1,Really the cream of the crop.   I honestly felt like I wasn't allowed to be in this hotel! It's just very modern and chic. There's chandeliers everywhere. This hotel is pretty pimped out. It's very very nice. The employees are just as nice and there was one lady that we talked to who was just a sweet heart.   will stay here one day!
5250,train,-1,"Pros- good view.  Big room.  Fun restaurants.  Cons- terrible service, lack of communication between departments and even within individual departments.  The room was dirty!  Gum mashed into the carpet, sticky items on the desk.  When checking in we spent forever getting our reservations sorted then when we got new keys it was like everything we did during check in didn't happen.  My friend left her key in the room and the front desk manager kept on contradicting himself saying that her husband could call to add her name then said he couldn't because they can't verify anything.  The manager was rude and condescending, he apologized but it was an empty apology because you could tell he was just saying it and didn't mean it.  We asked for housekeeping to come when we worked out and they didn't, then when we called to request it again they tried to blame us saying we had a DND on the door which we didn't.  Of all the possibilities out here for hotels you would think they would try to retain guests for future stays but I guess not.  I felt like just a number even though we brought 10+ rooms here and spent 7k at the club on property plus rooms revenue and food revenue.  Bad service, me and all my friends will never return here when we can go right next door to the aria or mandarin and actually be treated as a valued guest!!"
9266,train,1,"Service was great.  This old Inn was so beautiful and our suite was huge, clean, pretty and we loved it. We stayed here for out 20th anniversary.  Dinner was great.  I can't say enough good things about the Hillbrook."
4244,train,1,We bought VIP tickets online and tipped the Maitre' D $20 at the door. We were seated at the best center table up front that said 'Reserved'. The show was amazing. Don't miss the bathtub scene. Go!
4476,train,-1,"By far the worst customer service ever.  We've been owners in Sedona well before they bought the resort.  We used to enjoy our ownership very much.  Diamond Resorts has ruined that, they make it near impossible to trade, and it's starting to be even harder in our home resort.  They add charges for everything.  DO NOT EVER buy one of their packages, you'll regret it."
1592,train,-1,"Very dated, paint chipping and wallpaper peeling everywhere.  Needs a facelift and makes you worry about how clean everything really is.   Pull out sofa broken and not useable.  Breakfast was good and the attendant, Laura, was very nice.  We usually stay at the HI express chain but this was $40 cheaper.   You get what you pay for."
2985,train,-1,"I am a cheap bastard sometimes, and my brother is as well so when we saw just off the strip for less than $50 a night over a weekend average price, we thought what the hell. My brother is so cheap that he still wears shirts from when he was in High school, (he is currently 36). Regardless we thought 3 *s (official rating on most websites) all we really need is 2 beds and a bathroom. Well being blunt if this is 3 Stars then I think the box under the bridge with the homeless must rank at least 2 stars! there was no chair for the desk (how did that leave the room?) the decor looked like Jimmy buffet threw up after drinking one too many different colored margaritas, the carpet was just dirty, the bathroom had mold in the corners of the linoleum floor, There was a foot hole kicked through the bathroom door. But the wings at the bar downstairs were good!"
6038,train,1,We go to Las Vegas 5 or 6 times a year and we can't get ourselves to stay anywhere except the Cosmopolitan. We have stayed at ever hotel and this is by far our favorite. We love the balcony to overlook the Bellagio fountain. They usually offer us an upgrade for a nominal fee and we usually take it. The restaurants and great and so is the vibe. The pool is on the small side but we love the quaintness of it unlike some of these really busy pools at other places.
9583,train,0,"When traveling to Ohio on business colleagues recommended I stay here.  I realized that I am a hotel snob.  This place is fine.  It really is.  But it's barely a step above a motel.  I sat on the edge of the bed and the mattress sagged under my weight.  The sheets are super scratchy.  The decor is old & out of date.  There were various errant hairs in the shower (ew, right?!).  There is no room service.  And it was sub-zero temps and I didn't have a car for my first day and there isn't anything within walking distance when it's that cold (but in the summer it would be easy to walk for food).    To their credit:  the service is spectacular and friendly.  It is VERY quiet. They have a decent breakfast buffet in the morning (though it is not complimentary, it is inexpensive).  There's free internet (though it's not super speedy).  They're willing to help you get food delivered if you're hungry or arrange a ride to the airport for you.  I'll probably try out the Hyatt next door next time I'm in town.  It's a little cheaper and they have room service."
5449,train,1,"The hotel is WOW.  Stayed there in January and it was still getting the ""Kinks"" out I would say.  No adapters for international travelers (sign of a great hotel ;-)  We had a super glitch on check in which took forever, but we were upgraded to a view of the Bellagio fountains, so all good. The pools seem like they will be awesome in the summertime!  All in all cool new place on the strip, food was pretty good, club is overcrowded and line ridiculous, but there again, its Vegas."
2409,train,-1,"I stayed at 4 Queens for Labor day weekend. I ate at Mangolias quite a bit because I love prime rib and they have it 24/7. I ate there 3 days in a row until my recent experience with Management at 4Queens.  I decided to signup for the players card to get the discounted prime rib. I was very excited to join their players card and also decided to use the ""2 for 1 entries"" coupon that is given upon signup.   While dining, I overheard a couple who also just(I mean, just) signed up for the card convincing the other couple at the table to signup for the card because it included a 2 for 1 coupon.  As I went to pay I handed the coupon over and was told ""that isn't a coupon, its for new card holders who earn so many points in 24 hours. You get the coupon from the players card desk"".  I had mentioned that its even perforated like a coupon. I was then pointed to the fine print at the bottom of a 8x11 piece of paper that had the coupons for the 2 for 1 and a handful of other promos. No where on the coupon did it have any fine print or say ""not a coupon"". It only said this at the bottom of the complete page! The cashier had even mentioned ""this happens quite a bit, I don't know why they do this"".  I would not have gotten two meals if I knew this! I asked for a manager and was told nothing can be done besides informing the marketing department.  I was quite upset to be mislead by 4Queens marketing department and the lack of customer service provided in the situation, especially after spending 14 nights there since July and eating at Mangolias 7 or 8 times. Its also more upsetting that this seems like a common occurrence by the conversation I overheard and also the cashier's comment how ""customers make this mistake all the time"".   Its not customers making the mistake, its 4Queens mistake! 4Queens needs to change the wording on these coupons so it is clear you must earn points and redeem at the players card desk.  Im a vegas nut and visit every 6-8 weeks and don't plan to visit 4Queens or their sister properties after this 10.99$ error that 4queens refused to refund!"
8965,train,-1,"While claiming to ""love locals"" from every local television outlet, we were bemused by staff comments on service at Guadalajara, the Mexican bar & grill off the casino.  With a little less than an hour to show time, we considered a quick drink and snack at the bar, followed by a casual stroll to the show room.  20 minutes after sitting at a bar table, making repeated eye contact with the wait staff, we remained ignored.  Polite initiative resulted in chips & salsa, over-sweetened  lemonade and a margarita made from an off-the-shelf mix.  Table-side guacamole 'served with warm tortillas' was served with the same chips provided with the salsa.  We heard lame excuses about a power outage, being ""very busy"" and no through-put in the kitchen.  No back-up generators in a casino?  Really?  The surly waitress might have had a bad night, but that's no excuse for being rude.  The manager was apologetic and made compensatory overtures which were appreciated.  How difficult is it to get service right from the onset when a guest enters the dining or drinking area?  After all, it's Las Vegas!  But what about ""We Love Locals!""?  Why is management so blind to the quality level of service in such a competitive environment?  Is the economy so dreadful that staff is hired without appropriate training in ""hope"" that ""things will work out""?  While Guadalajara at Boulder Station stands as an example, it's not the only venue suffering from arrogant service staff, ill equipped from a lack of training or the business values imbued from a successful and attractive destination.  Re-directing investments from TV advertising to staff training and business execution will result in more demand from word of mouth and repeat customers happy with their experience."
2365,train,1,Hotel is okay but this is for Joe at the Valet.  He is the best!  Very friendly! Very quick!  Great worker.  You could talk to him all night because he is so personable! Tip him at least 5$ when you park and 5$ again when you receive car.  He deserves it plus more!  Thanks Joe!
2317,train,-1,"This review is just for the Hooters Restaurant and not the Casino or Hotel.    Pros-The Beer was cold and fairly cheap compared to other places we visited, facilities were clean and the wait staff were fairly prompt.  Cons- My wife and I went here for wings and ordered the Spicy Garlic which we both love.  Every other time at every other Hooters, these wings are very strong with Garlic flavor with a little spice.  These wings were just the opposite.  They were overpowered with heat and almost no garlic flavor.   My wife and I could not finish a 10 piece that we were sharing and she likes much hotter foods than I do.  I spent more time wiping the sweat from my forehead than I did eating or drinking while we were here.   Would have been a 1 Star if not for the Pros listed above.  I'm not saying not to go here,  I'm saying don't order these wings unless you have a cast iron stomach."

Staying in hotels 2 weeks out of every month you start to expect things...that this hotel could not deliver and was not willing to try. Pvc pipe was sticking out of ceiling above my tub to drain the leak from the room above me I can only assume.  Ac unit dripping water all over the carpet.  Every staff member I encountered was rude.  Keep in mind my hours only let me see staff from 4-5am and after 5pm. I called from work to extend one more night and was told no problem...arrive at hotel and go to get my key updated to be told they were sold out and I had to check out when I was scheduled.  Probably a blessing in disguise!!! Notes...bad neighborhood, dirty carpet, stinky room. I will never stay here again and will reschedule a trip if every other hotel is full within 20 mile radius!!"
1571,train,-1,Is it possible to feel unhappy; insulted & a little scared whilst checking in to a hotel in Las Vegas. Oh definitely at the 4 Queens on Fremont. A booking was made 4 months in advance to celebrate a wedding renewal of vows. All the rooms were to be on the same floor. Due to construction guests were on all different floors. The manager was unavailable...... when we were adamant about wanting to speak to a manager the receptionist called security. Yes: security. A course on guest services would be appropriate as I have never experienced such an uncomfortable checking in experience to a hotel.
3634,train,1,Awesome fun sexy show.  Tipped the doorman 15 bucks which got us a table upfront and without going into details was the best tip ever. We actually got the tickets free through the timeshare sales folks....said we were already owners and asked if they could help with discount tickets and out came the free tickets.  If you are looking for a late night vegas show can't go wrong with Sexxy!
2892,train,-1,Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different.
3642,train,1,I have seen over 25 shows in Vegas and this is one of the best! My fiancÃ© loved the girls. I loved the singing and performances. The upper body strength of these women is amazing. Some cirque du soleil style acrobatics and great vocals. Great for men but also fun for the girlfriends too! Not sleazy at all. Great talent. Would recommend.
4725,train,-1,"Terrible terrible casino hosts (Bobby & David Bentley).  The hosts at the Cosmopolitan treat you poorly and do not take care of their players.  I will NEVER be back to this hotel again, nor spend any money thereof again!  Also, there resort fee is $30...what a joke!"
4711,train,1,This review is not about the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino this review is about the pizza I've been to New York and Chicago many times and this pizza kills it it is definitely the best pizza and it's definitely a stop every time I come to Las Vegas so this is an absolute must try its on the third floor its called mystery pizza there's no sign on the outside it's just go the whole way you walk into electro small pizza parlor try the white pizza with ricotta and fresh mozzarella plain cheese is always excellent pepperonis good Italian sausage is wonderful and they have a meatball pizza that's very very good
5555,train,-1,"We only went here to see comedian Vinnie Favorito (who, by the way is a MUST-SEE comedian),.  But how can a hotel offer 2 beers and 2 wines as the only beverage offerings during a comedy show?  What the?  Piss poor, F minus on that.  Complete dump of a lobby.  Management has let this place go downhill."
3733,train,1,"They did good at first. Got our chicken wings, basket of fries, & our drinks right away. The food & drinks hit the spot! After that we asked for an order of Fried pickles since i really wanted to try them but did I pay a price, it took more than 30mins to get. The server did great though checking in with us... But really wished those fried pickles hadn't taken so long"

Our suite was gorgeous from the decor to the amazing view we had!  Our bedroom had a comfortable king size bed with endless amounts of pillows and a flat screen TV! We had two full bathrooms. The one in our bedroom had a large shower with glass doors, a marble tub, two sinks and a private toilet. We had a full kitchenette that even had a sub zero refrigerator for wine!  We also had a small dining area and living room with a flat screen tv!  To top it off the location of this hotel is in the center of the strip everything is within walking distance. Will definitely be staying here every time I visit Vegas!"
837,test,0,"Newer hotel close to campus. Lots of restaurants and bars around. We stayed here overnight for an accepted student orientation with our daughter and nephew at U of I. Rooms were spacious and well-appointed. City parking garage is adjacent to the hotel, so parking wasn't a problem.   They lose a star though because while I booked the hotel through Hotels.com, they wouldn't transfer the booking to my husband's Marriott Rewards account so we could get points for it. Annoying, but NBD.   They lose another star for the absolutely terrible free breakfast. Having 3 teenagers, we always book hotels with a free buffet breakfast, and know what to expect. Toast, maybe bagels, some sort of cereal, apples and bananas, sometimes yogurt, sometimes eggs (powdered, I know) and the ever-present waffle maker. It's something to put in your stomach until you can grab something when you're on your way. However, their breakfast was just terrible. Their 'hot' breakfast consisted of hamburger buns with very low quality ham and cheese in between. Even my 18 year-old nephew thought it was gross, and teenage boys will eat mostly anything. Also, it was totally packed due to the U of I accepted student orientation, so other options like yogurt and granola bars were all gone :( I would hope their breakfast offerings are better when they're not quite as busy!"
4979,train,1,"Knowing that the Cosmo had filed for bankruptcy basically since they opened (but I think it's now owned by another company), I was afraid my experience here would not be good.  My friend booked us 2 suites with balconies. My room was a king bed suite with 2 bathrooms & fully equipped kitchen. The fridge was fully stocked with everything I could want! If I wanted to pay an outrageous amount for water, soda, etc.. My view was ridiculously perfect! Most of the staff I came in contact with were great people, especially my room service people who brought me my food! They were so fun to joke around with & talk to! Which made me happy because I often tip well. My flight wasn't until 6pm, so I called front desk to ask for a later check out. They gave me a 2pm Checkout! Which was so perfect!  I never went into the casino area since I do not gamble, but the Cosmo does have great lounge areas & other food options if you are not wanting to order room service. Also a few nice shops.  All in all... My stay was such a great experience!"
88,train,0,"Visited again Feb 2014.  They've actually put some effort in here.  Looked cleaner, drink service was good, hot dogs were good (and cheap), some nice machines.  They have pool tables (which I find odd in a casino...not a big money maker).  An ok mix of gambling machines (smallest casino I've seen, some gas stations have more variety), I saw zero live tables, but to be fair to them, they seem to be making an effort compared to the disaster I saw a couple of years ago.  Not at all crowded mid day Wednesday.  Nice little store with good prices.  Decent dining options, I like the roomy feel with the machines not jammed together.  Amazingly I went from hating this place to considering it as an occasional diversion.  2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3."

Everything sounded awesome at the presentation.  I had a few concerns though.  First, what if I lose my job?  Your timeshare can be sold.  Good luck with that.  Second concern, why so many bad reviews.  The salesman said every company has bad reviews.  Can't please everyone, right?  That is a fair statement.  I really think they should be higher though.  The reviews were bad to horrible.  How hard can it be to get good reviews when people go on vacation?  This is when people should be in the best of moods.  After about 2.5 hours I just told him there was no chance of me signing anything with so many concerns.  They kept returning with better offers.  Probably went down over half of the original amount.  I just thought what difference does that make.  I am afraid whatever I give them will just go to waste anyways.  I told them I was concerned about possibly planning a vacation where I want to go (like Hawaii) and only say Tucson being available.  That would not be cool!  After I told him there is zero chance I will sign today.  I did think possibly more research could change my mind.  One of the salesman became livid.  He went off on me saying that I need to be more positive.  The 2 night stay in California is not free.  You have to pay taxes.  Why did you come here?  He kept going on trying to make me look bad for not buying in.  My wife was very glad we did not sign after all this.  He reeked of cigarettes.  We have yet to go on this trip that is supposedly not free because of taxes.  We will see how that goes.  I considered leaving without the trip even"
8875,train,-1,"The hotel is undergoing renovations... With that being said, I expected more from my room... Everything was falling apart, the pull out bed mattress was horrible, uncomfortable... Stained. There were two towels in my room, it was me and three kids staying in our room, I had to call down and ask for extras, then had to wait 30-45 min for the towels to arrive. The pull out bed had no linen, I had to wait extended periods of time for linen for that bed. I think they may have some sort of flea or bug problem, me and one child had bite marks all over our legs... It was just the two of us that had this issue, and we slept on the king sized bed... Really disappointed"

7252,train,1,"The journey for me begins with parking, because to me, parking is make-or-break for a good night's stay. While parking is almost never a problem in Vegas, I found the Cosmo parking garage to be quite nice. Spaces are marked with individual lights depicting whether the spot that you covet is empty or full. This is a true win in my book. Get in, get your spot, and get on your way.   After a walk from the garage into the main hotel lobby, you continue your journey to your room. (For me, the Terrace Sweet)...  Your senses are given a show when you arrive to check into this interesting place. Images flitter across the walls providing you with distraction while waiting  to get your keys. Employees are nice and well put together.   As you finally arrive to your room (a walk not as far as some hotels - such as the MGM Grand), you are greeted with personalization on the TV and telephone.  Crisp white and cobalt-colored linens adorn the comfortable beds.   There is a small kitchenette with a convenient sink for your stay. Adjacent is a cozy living space with couch and table covered in beautiful art books. This didn't thrill my husband as much as myself. What a great touch!   Each detail of this room was well-though through, even down to the wallpaper inside of the closet. If you are a Fornasetti fan, then you'll love the famous Fornasetti Plate wallpaper hidden within the closet.   The restrooms have a beautiful iridescent tile on the shower walls. The mirror is large enough to prepare to look your best for the day.   The private terrace is my favorite aspect of the room. This is a rare treat in Vegas. Your room comes with a lovely view, normally, and this is a great place to spend the sunrise or sunset- if you want to take time to enjoy these types of things while in the Sin City. I had the lower-tier view of the Henderson side of the building, but love this view, so I was thrilled.  Other highlights:  Secret Pizza - Simply the best pizza around. Maybe it's the fact that it's secret? (Well, not really anymore). LOVE IT!   Marquee Nightclub - Love the different themed rooms here, but the club is quite claustrophobic compared to the larger open-style clubs that are usually seen around town. It definitely make this one unique. .. . but I just don't prefer it.  I do, however, LOVE the vast selection of artists that the Cosmo brings in to play/mix here.   Artist in residency - Some of the best artists show off their work for YOU to see.   The Henry - Not bad at all. I like to people watch here if I can get a good seat.    In nearby Aria - Jean Philippe Patisserie - LOVE the macarons.   In nearby Mandarin Oriental - Mozen Bistro - EVEN BREAKFAST is amazing here.   So - highlights in summary - Fresh view, delicious food, comfortable stay."

3583,train,-1,"Nope. This place sucks. My buddy thought it would be neat to get two hotel rooms for $50 (total). Yeah, you get what you pay for.  Wierd surf, wood panel decor, old 80s art, and uncomfortable beds. A group of four of us asked to open a new blackjack table since all (3 - the place is tiny) were busy AND had people waiting. The pit boss simply said ""no."" Thanks ass-wee-pay"

Also it has a Keurig machine-bring along some Keurig pods!!! There is air conditioning in the room in the form of a wall unit. It works well but it is very noisy. Walls are thin. Shower warmed up quick and had great pressure. I suggest bringing your own soap. The soap provided is not that great and has an overpowering smell.   Proximity 4/5 Close to the strip.

5102,train,-1,"REVIEWING THE RESTAURANT ONLY  We had company here from out of town and he really wanted to eat at Hooter's, so we indulged him.  I had never been to this location and I won't be back.  First off, the hostess kept us waiting for about 10 minutes while they ""cleaned off a table"" (mind you, there were only 4 of us).  As we were being seated, there were plenty of empty tables so I'm not sure what that was all about.  We interacted with three different hostess/waitresses and all were very rude.  The food was terrible.  One guest in our party had the steamed shrimp for $11.49. There were maybe 12 smallish shrimp on her plate (no side dishes for this price by the way) and shelling the shrimp seemed to be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  One guest had the fish and chips - he said it had no real taste at all.  I tried the chili (which I have loved at other locations) and here it was very bland and the texture was more like a can of cat food.  All this was after a 32 minute wait for our food.  I know that because by the time we finally got seated I started worrying about the flight our guests had to catch so I was watching the clock.  Not once during this time did a waitress come to refill drinks or let us know our food was on its way.  In fact, we didn't see her at all until she brought the food out.  I tried voicing my concerns about the food and the wait but the waitress looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language and dropped off our check and walked away.  I usually give people and restaurants the benefit of the doubt but I really think unless you happen to be staying at this hotel and don't want to bother going somewhere else, steer clear."
5992,train,1,"I like automatic valet pick-up, valet lounge and TV check out. It saves lots of time. The hotel is hip, modern, fashionable and makes you feel super comfortable. I like the office part of the suit with all the up-to-date ports and leather trims of desk and  cool stationary, makes the work true pleasure! I love the decor, bold but romantic theme floating throughout everything, even the view from jacuzzi and the see-through glass shower, art books. I love the view, different suit lay-outs and the way they treat me!!! Why would I need to try anything else if I got Cosmo?"
2295,train,1,"Must wanted to say thank you to Lindsay and Kelsey from the bar. Excellent service and very attentive.  My Partner in Dining (PID) went here recently for a small lunch. It was about 11:30am and we ended up here by accident because my PID took a wrong turn. Definitely worth it!  We were immediately able to get seats at the bar. Lindsay quickly greeted us and took our drink orders. We got two pints of Blue Moon ($6 each) to start.  Afterwards we ordered the honey chipotle wings with bleu cheese and a side of curly fries. The place was fairly busy, but it seemed that everyone was getting taken care of. Lots of birthdays were being celebrated so there was lots of singing.  Our food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. The wings and fries hit the spot and went down well with the Blue Moon.  The restaurant is very clean, and able to accommodate larger parties. What's also great is the food is affordable. Yes the location is on the south end of the strip, but if you need some good old wings, you can't go wrong.  On tap I believe in addition to Blue Moon there's Coors and Red's Apple Cider (that's a first). There were others but I don't quite remember them.  Until next time, Wing Wednesday is every day!"

8330,train,0,"**** This review is for the casino only ****  I drive past Lucky Dragon now and then and decided today I'd see what it was like.  As everyone notes, it is a small casino.  When I was there around 2 PM, there were about 8 people in the place.  Everything is new and clean and I didn't notice anyone smoking which was a bonus.  Dragon's Alley was closed so there was no option to get a late lunch here.  The parking garage is OK but beware of many drivers who don't know how to drive.  One person had to wave me ahead because she couldn't drive by me in her little Scion.  She was just one of a couple of drivers of whom you must be aware.  I didn't have any interaction with staff so I cannot rate customer service.  OK casino but it won't be a first or second choice.  I think I'm one and done!"
5157,train,1,"I only reccommend going here after midnight because the wings are 25 cents each!   You cannot go wrong with that, but expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Yeah, it sounds like a long time, but if you're drunk enough and you can send someone to put your name on the list, it is definitely worth it."
5268,train,1,"Four words: Terrace Studio Fountain View  You won't be any happier with your room!   I think we paid around $200 a night and that rate also included the buffet at The Wicked Spoon restaurant. The buffet was probably one of the best buffets that I've ever had.   Every part of our stay at The Cosmopolitan was a lesson in great customer service.  It's a well run establishment that impresses at every turn.  They had quite a large LGBTQ presence in both staffing and guests.    The pool on the 14th floor was more our speed: mellow and chill. The pool on the 4th floor was energetic and pretty young. It was nice to have a choice!  Every restaurant that we ate in was very good too.  Secret Pizza, DOCG and my favorite---Beauty and Essex.    Again, our studio was beautiful and overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Paris just added to the ambiance.   Check-in was a breeze.  Special shout out to Diego!  Clap! Clap! Clap! Best part of checking out was that I was able to do it on my phone. This place is very hip and very cool.   We couldn't have been any happier."

7491,test,-1,"Overpriced poser-ville. I can't tell you just how much I hate this hotel, and now Vegas in general. That may be the lens I'm seeing this hotel through because Vegas isn't the ""Vegas"" I remember anymore -at least in my eyes. It's obnoxiously expensive, gaudy, and the clientele here (and everywhere in this town) has become a walking spoof of Kardashian-like self absorbed airheads in ill fitting clothes and garish amounts of tattoos, and that's just the ladies.   The reservation I made was for a balcony room but was suddenly unavailable once we checked in. Front desk attendant (Melissa) was rude and not accommodating in the least. I would've liked to know prior to my arrival because I would have stayed elsewhere.  Her attitude was too bad, so sad - give me your credit card.   As far as the hotel goes - hang onto your wallet. Want breakfast for 2? $60+ tip. Lunch? $80+ tip. Dinner? $300 or so and this is even when ordering very modestly. Less than 20 years ago I could find deals galore on food and drinks. Now a round of drinks for two (domestic beer and a low end mixed drink) are $25 with tip. Want to get out to another hotel with your rental car? Many of the hotels now charge by the hour to park. That used to be a freebie to encourage crowds to come to your casino. Now each hotel parking lot is an ATM for them (as if their odds weren't already stacked) I had show tickets down the street at NY NY and they wanted $20 to $30 to let us self or valet park our car during a cirque du soleil show because guess what? T-Mobile arena rented ALL the garage spaces from NY NY. So guys like me get to walk a mile to park just to see the overpriced cirque du soleil show.   In short - I hate this hotel, the employees, and now I even hate the city itself. So long sin city!  You won't get to gouge me again."
7086,train,1,"Love this hotel... The overall appearance of the hotel is very nice, well kept and always clean... The rooms are spacious, well laid out and the walk in shower/Japanese style soaking tub overlooking the strip were top notch. Looking forward to staying here next time I am in Vegas."
1749,test,0,Set up like any Hyatt Place this property is only about a 7 minute drive from the airport and has a complimentary shuttle that was purchased two months ago. Upon checking in I was greeted as a Diamond Elite member and offered my usual check in points or beverage amenity as well as 50% any appetizers I wanted to order. As I was at the desk I noticed a really bad odor that smelled like someone had taken a dump right in the middle of the lobby and it was disgusting! Hyatt Place normally has a distinct smell to it that is pumped into the vents that I absolutely love. Later when I went up to my room I got a text message that asked me to respond back with anything I needed and to rate my level of satisfaction thus far. At the time I gave them 3 stars and it said someone would be contacting me to discuss any issues I was having and would like to have a chance to correct them. After being on site for 3 more days and 2 more separate reservations I got the same message and only gave one star hoping to actually be contacted and I never was. If it wasn't for the smelly lobby each day and actually being contacted to discuss what the issue was I would have given this property 5 stars.
3786,train,-1,"We booked this hotel based on Orbitz 4 star rating...and the great price and in turn learned all 4 stars are not created equal. The staff was nice and friendly and that's where the ""good"" ends.  The room was small and dated, the elevators extremely slow...and they do not have a  bellhop.  All this said we had planned on making the best of it and sticking it out, but at 4am after getting next to no sleep (the bed is the worst I've sleep on...camping is better) I called Orbitz and switched to a real 4 star hotel.  Best decision!"
4730,train,0,It's ok. The pool party is ok and the club is ok. Nothing spectacular. It doesn't match the quality of the room! No use for a full kitchen tho. The Casino is small. It's a pain using the key in the elevator all the time. The hotel is definitely set up to cater for long term stayers. but the price is set up for weekend warriors. I'm confused. Wait I know the rooms were meant to be sold not rented out. I guess they couldnt sell the condos so they turned into a hotel.  I still prefer MGM or Palazzo and their group
4514,test,-1,"On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a wedding and my birthday, and this is where i chose to stay.  BAD IDEA !!  This place is for the birds.  What a dump !  Avoid staying here at all costs.  Im giving it two stars only because the casino has really low limits on there tables.  And the pool actually looked descent.   So i requested a Non smoking king bed room in their tower for a pretty good deal.  This is how i was lured in (low prices) we were working with a budget this trip.  I get there to check in and they tell me they don't have a non smoking king room in the tower.  (even though i had called a few days prior to make sure it was reserved)  Idiots !! So i settle with a smoking king room on the 3rd floor.  Get in the room and the first thing i notice is the industrial AC unit for the whole casino/hotel is outside our balcony and its humming like a tractor. FUCKKK NO !!  so i go ask for a new room right away.  Finally a different guy gets us a non smoking room w/ king bed in the tower on the 10th floor.  much better, but still the rooms are only a step above motel 6.     Tip: you end up spending more money taking cabs to the strip every night than it would cost to upgrade to a nicer hotel/casino.  Spend the extra cash to get a better room at a better hotel.    The food was ok, takes a long time for a ""to go"" order. beers were cheap.  bottom line: stay somewhere else if you can afford it.  Hooters is good for gambling only !!!!!"

3984,train,1,"Service. Superb service. The shower was the most amazing experience ... a waterfall of heaven that literally cleared up my husbands asthma while we were there. The la'occatane soap also helped with the asthma....now I get him that soap in his stocking every christmas. The beds...left us all well rested. (Two of us and teanage daugther)  Now for the amazing part of our story. We are not rich by any means and had booked a 2 nite stay at this horrible hotel (south point) for a driving mini vacation. We called ahead to tell the hotel wed be late checking in...1 am. They said no problem ... but when we got there they had given our room away...leaving us only a smoking room....revisit the above comment about my husbands asthma...we couldn't stay there. So we started looking for another hotel, unaware that an Arbonne convention left the entire city booked up. We pulled into a driveway thinking it was Mandalay Bay, but pulled up to the Four Seasons. instead..when we walked in we sure noticed. We explained the predicament to the front desk, as well as the fact that although we thought their resort was lovely we were looking for something a little 'less'. They called and called right there in front of us, tons of hotels on the strip, so that we wouldn't have to keep driving and checking! After about 10 'we're sorry we're booked' answers, we gave up and checked into the Four Seasons thinking...we'll splurge for these 2 nights.   I have never, ever, had such a wonderful experience in a hotel. I have stayed in some nice hotels in Boston and Vegas, but never experienced the luxury and service like here.   My dream used to be to stay at the Bellagio..but I think I'll forget the themes and just stay at the Four Season's if I'm ever so lucky as to be able to.   Also complete bonus, but when we wrote a letter to express our gratitude and amazement of our experience my husband actually received one back from the President of the hotel, with very specific references to our stay! Pretty cool, probably written by some assistant, but still pretty darn cool!"

8023,train,0,"So, I just read Cynthia C's review and just about puked when I read about the squiggly HAIR in her food? wTF? Hairs are bad enough, but SQUIGGLY? We all know what those tend to be! Gagggggggg  I'm also wondering about that great lip balm and toothbrush provided in Cynthia's room, because they sure as heck weren't in mine! Now I feel really jipped!      I just returned from a weekend at the Cosmo.I was there for a conference, so there is a lot to do with the hotel that I can't even comment on at all. I thought the suite was great, although not my style, who cares? It was a weekend, and I expect that in Vegas. The suite was enormous. The bed comfy. The mini bar, already depleted when I got in the room (and then the charge was on my bill...but removed when pointed out). The shower/tub/window view, etc was pretty cool. No serious problems with temp. There were definitely dirty areas of the room, which is disgusting. When I'm forking out $660 for two nights, I don't want to find hairs, thick dust and filth all over the sliding doors hampering my view of Vegas. Definitely creepy feeling. Only cleaned out one sink the second day. Cleaning staff is definitely the most lacking.        The view of the Bellagio fountains was great...and just how spacious the balcony was. I ordered room service one night, and it was relatively quick, decent tasting, and the server who delivered was quite friendly. The staff in general didn't seek you out to check on you, but if you approached them with questions, etc, they were all very friendly and helpful. Tip: much fresher and more economical drinks in Vitals - the 24 hour store near checkin. Maybe even more variety of food and snacks would be great.      Oh yeah, also, the second TV in my suite didn't work. It made obnoxiously loud sounds and just wouldn't ever correct itself. No remote for that tv either. Restaurant selection was lacking, they really need to offer something more basic and/or casual. let's see. i had three or four screwdrivers throughout the weekend and they were all slightly different than each other. Only one was truly orange, which is frightening really. I chose a screwdriver because I thought it would be so basic and simple. Ha the screwdriver cost nearly $11, and of course was tiny. The hotel felt like a meat market, at least at night. but, maybe all of vegas is that way at night? Other positives: quick elevators to all floors and the chandelier bar was beautiful."
1621,train,1,"Not sure what the lackluster reviews are about for this place. It's brand new. It's reasonably priced through any third-party vendor. The location is convenient. It's clean. The staff is friendly. Not much more I could expect.  For the people complaining about the breakfast...it's a free continental breakfast. No...the eggs are not prepared by Wolfgang Puck, but in a pinch, if you want to get some free food in your gut before embarking on the day, this gets the job done. If you want a really delicious breakfast, go somewhere and pay for it. The scrambled eggs and bacon were serviceable. Would I be disappointed if I went out to breakfast and got served the same stuff? Certainly. Are they reminiscent of the bacon and eggs I ate at a strip club buffet in 2009? Yes, but that's neither here nor there.   I've stayed here twice in the last two months and the only gripes I have are that the Wi-Fi sucks, so you need to use a personal hotspot and the address of the place can send your GPS on a long detour depending on where you're coming from. There's a road that runs up behind the place (Banksville Ave., not Banksville Rd.) between the hotel and the light at Crane. You'll can save time by using that - otherwise you'll get routed through downtown 85% of the time."
8624,test,0,"Was headed to Scottsdale and looking for a comfortable/clean, yet not overly fancy place to stay. We knew that we would be out of the hotel more often than not, so wanted to save some money on accommodations...  THE SCOOP: The staff here were great, from the folks that checked us in, to the housekeeping staff. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bed was great, everything was clean. The hotel offers a complimentary full breakfast and happy hour. The breakfast was definitely impressive (made to order eggs, bacon, french toast, you name it). It worked well for us, since we were up early and off for the whole day. Definitely visit the onsite restaurant. We typically have little faith in hotel restaurants, but this place was fantastic.  THE POOP: As many reviews have stated, this place definitely is a bit worn. You can tell there hasn't been a remodel in decades (however it is clean!). The complimentary happy hour and breakfast are a great perk, but the lines can get outrageous. The room, while clean, had no aesthetic value. Also the guests in the hotel tended to be a bit rowdy for our taste.   THE RECOMMENDATION: We might stay here again, but only if we couldn't find a better deal elsewhere."
1624,train,1,"This is the newest casino in Vegas and in my opinion the fanciest.  The first thing I saw when I walked in was Bond bar.  There were girls dancing in the ceiling.  The DJ booth looked like it was from Tron and he had a guy suit playing the electric guitar behind him.  Walked to the next bar Chandelier which is a multi-level bar in a big ass chandelier.  Every floor was doper than the last.  Plenty of table and easy access to the bartenders everywhere.  I've never seen a place like this.  Next I walked thru the casino floor.  There was club music playing and no old people or kids.  I busted out the expletives and did my philandering.  And I gotta admit this place had HBD, high bitch density.  Top caliber too and that's not the alcohol that talking, because I noticed a light peppering of mingas in the mix.  Even my gay buddy said he was going straight for the night.  I eventually made my way to the front of the hotel near the check-in area.  They had these 6x6 mirrored columns running along the floor.  But they weren't mirrored.  They was LED screens!  I was checking my hair out in my reflection and all the sudden the image changes.  Blew my mind."

Our room was good minus the fact that they forgot to give us shampoo and conditioner the first night and one of the faucets wasn't working. However, they made up for it when we asked and even gave us some chocolates for the inconvenience.  The restaurants were pricey but that's probably expected. The nice gym in the West building closes early at 8 PM unfortunately. Had some issues with Wifi, even though we had to pay extra (the daily resort fee) for it.  Enjoyed our stay overall and thought the service was great."

Yeah, that's the one. That would seem like a suite at the Ceasar's during a free money give away to every room compared to the hell hole that is the Hooter ""Hotel"". Right when I get to my room, I think it's not to bad. Little view of the pool, 2 beds, and a door. Functional right?? That's where the good times ended for that room. Right when I went to open the ""balcony"" door to have a look over the pool, the door was already off the railing. Luckily my buddy and I were able to place said door back on the railing. So with our door from finally closed, we decided to turn on the A/C as it was hotter than the Devils asshole after Indian food night in hell in our room. Low and behold it doesn't work. So after tinkering (flipping the knob until something happened) for a while, it goes from summer on the sun to a nice cooled room that now smells of antifreeze. So we let it blow it's little heart out when it decides that it had an epiphany and decided to change its lifeless being and become a fire breathing dragon. So here we are back to summer on the sun. I can't help but laugh as we turn off the demon spawn of Elsa and Trigon (Comic book villain). We decided, the next morning, to head to another casino where our friends were at thinking that at least we'll have a clean room to come back to. Wanna guess what didn't happen????? You got it!!! No one came to clean anything. I know that we're grown men and we should be able to keep a clean room (which we did for the most part), but I mean come on. Same towels in a pile on the floor. Same way the beds were left. Not even as much as an eyelash was moved. We clean up the room, wash up (face towel after my shower) and headed out. Next day, we decided to see if something would change. Oddly enough it did. Someone came up to our room and made one of the beds and left some water bottles. Towels were still in a pile though. We start laughing and brush it off. Decided that it's not worth talking to management over as I'm leaving anyway. So here I am just to let anyone who thinks that this place would be a suitable place to stay as it's super cheap. Don't.. Save your money or just throw it into a fireplace because that's worth waaaaaayyyyy more to watch than stay at the Hooters ""Hotel""."
1995,train,1,"I recently went on a business trip for training and stayed here. I loved it the employees are so pleasent and always nice. They always are very helpful. They have a little store within the hotel which was really helpful since I landed so late in the night and didn't want to stop for food after. Also its in a great locoation not to far from shopping centers. They also have a shuttle that will take you five miles away. The hotel is very clean.  Breakfest is also great, lots of options. I stayed here for a week for my trip and I will go back to this hotel next time for sure! Also love the Pool !"
1475,train,0,Overall - OK. BEDS SEEMED CLEAN. rooms were clean - but no friggen elevators?!?!wow. I'm writing another line so this is a review and not a tip. Am I there yet??
8838,train,1,"Das Marriott in Sindelfingen bietet allen typischen Marriott Standard den man erwarten kann. CheckIn verlief super schnell und unkompliziert. Im Zimmer angekommen fallen die vielen Kissen Aug dem Bett auf. Da ist fÃ¼r jedem etwas dabei. Die Zimmer sind bisher noch ziemlich Old-school aber alles wird besser. Im Moment wird gerade das gesamte Hotel renoviert. Das heiÃt Ende Mai erstrahlen alle Zwei im neuen Design. Da freue ich mich jetzt schon drauf.  Bis dahin kann man aber trotzdem noch sehr gut dort wohnen.  Ich war Ã¼berrascht vom kleinen Fitnessraum der aber mit sehr vielen GerÃ¤ten ausgestattet ist. Da kann das Training ordentlich durchgefÃ¼hrt werden. Auch das viele Obst was im Fitnessbereich zur VerfÃ¼gung steht spornt zu HÃ¶chstleistungen an.  Das Personal ist super freundlich und zuvorkommend.  Das muss ich wirklich hervorheben.  Insgesamt also schon jetzt ein sehr gutes Hotel,  nach der Renovierung dann noch besser."
952,train,-1,"service was rude , the food Is not good . i do not recommend this place. dEbbie the waitress was not nice at all. very dry attitude."
1504,train,1,"Let's start with reviewing the business... I read the reviews and comments like ""riff raff"" in the area, It's downtown Vegas and you are staying in a $20/night room not $200/night on the strip.   So, I found the Queens to be top tier. We arrived, check in was quick and easy. Went to the elevators, easy to find, unlike many other casinos I have been to, up to the 18th floor and to the room.   The room was nicely decorated, just like any other hotel room, there were no smells or smoke or otherwise. Everything appeared clean, I always look for bugs or other nastiness. Had a great view of the strip.   The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on in as long as I can remember. Far better than the Bellagio bed was. Most hotel beds feel like they are a sheet draped over a piece of plywood. I actually got a wonderful night sleep and woke up well rested and ready to go. The wake up call was prompt.   Got ready, went downstairs for the free breakfast, which just acceptable, will review that separately, Magnolias.  We used the gaming coupons they provided us for joining their players club, took the $10 in free slot play, played for about 90 minutes which was fun, Turned the free $10 into $12.78 that we walked away with. The people on the gaming floor were very helpful, there is a complicated way to get your free money off the card into the machine, and the person we talked to got us going...  So we took the winnings, free money, and used $10 of it with the $10 table ""match bet"" and played Craps. Threw 7 out the door, turned the $10 from the slots into $40. Pocketed $20 and we played for about 2 hours on that $20. Up and down, until we busted.   Free drinks while playing, they do that everywhere,  but all in all we got 3-4 hours of exciting entertainment, free drinks, breakfast, parking and came out $23 bucks ahead, not bad for a $20 room cost.  We went out the Fremont Street Experience. Interesting and different that I remember it being before... looks like when Hollywood kicked all the ""characters"" (batman, superman, etc) off Hollywood Blvd they all moved to Vegas. Plus there were showgirls from all the casinos and Chippendale dancers everywhere."
6629,train,1,"Cosmopolitan is the hot young neighbor to move to the center of the Las Vegas Strip. Imagine a sleek boutique hotel on a much grander scale.  The Day and Nightclub, Marquee includes a breathtaking pool (See my review). Other lounges including Bond, Vesper Bar in the Lobby, and Chandelier Bar (a 3 story lounge with the perimeter enclosed by giant crystal chandeliers). Cosmopolitan may not host Cirque du Soleil daily but they do boast an impressive changing lineup of Top Performers. A weeklong stay almost guarantees you could catch a great show.  14 restaurants include Scarpetta, an Italian Restaurant yelp rated as 4.5/5 stars. The rooms are minimalist yet elaborate and you can snag a 1,000 sq. ft. suite with 1.5 bathrooms and a view many weekends for $600 a nt. Second to Bellagio this is the place to stay on the strip."
5594,train,-1,"I straight up hate this place. Is that enough of a review? No? Okay well let me tell you why I hate this hotel.  Arriving at the hotel your hit in the face with the most awful scent ever. My boyfriend described it as ""urinal cakes"". Yummy.  Check in went fine, and we headed up to our room. Well we walk in and the room is boiling hot. Turn on the lights and it looked like someone attacked the shower area. The only covering that makes the shower private was sprayed out across the floor. Looked like an angry bear mauled it.  We called down and they sent someone up about 20 mins later. Mind you it's past midnight at this point, we're hungry and tried. As we waited we noticed the tv wasnt working. Well maintenance fixed that, but said the shower cover curtain thing will be held off till morning. They never came to fix it.   So good thing I was rooming with the boyfriend otherwise it would have been rather uncomfortable showering with the world to see.  Our mini fridge and bar food area was half stocked. That's cool..okay thanks? No hangers, except two that said to enjoy their bathrobes. Those didn't exist!  Before heading to bed we ripped the place apart searching for the 'do not disturb' sign. Well it didn't exist. So we called down and said ""hey please don't send room cleaning over-we don't want it"".   Next morning as I'm snoozing away. Some dude parades in and walks all the way to the bed before realizing I'm there. He left right away, but whoa come on!  (Happened three mornings in a row after calling them and saying not to send anyone up).  When we did ask for the room cleaning they never restocked our toilet paper (there was also none when we arrived)...thanks! Also we were charged $76 for the room cleaning. That's never happened to us in vegas before.  We called down again to have the mini fridge cleared out (not that there was much anyway). Well the lady came she grabbed everything then stocked our stuff carefully above the sensors. LOL!   During check out low and behold we were charged for everything the woman took out of the bar. They took it off but what a hassle that was.   Btw the restaurants suck here. We tried three and they all sucked.   Guys and gals.. Don't stay here. Go to the encore."
4866,train,0,"My friends were too lazy and hungover to go elsewhere, so we decided to go to go to Hooters, since it was across the street from our hotel.  It was my first time here, so I was kind of excited.  I came with 3 of my guy friends.  They got soup and we ordered the 50 pc wings which were all so dry.  Guess it's overly priced b/c they have waitresses in their outfits.  Being my first time here, I just thought it was funny we had a pregnant waitress; at least she was fit haha. The wings were so dry, I used up 3/4 of a new bottle of Hooters hot sauce.  My friends were shocked how much hot sauce I used up.  They thought I was messing around when I poured a lot of sauce on my plate.  Nope, I love sauce in general lol  If people like girls in those outfits, they should checkout the Viet cafes.  You'll see more for a cheaper price LOL  My first time, probably my last..."
7910,test,0,"I'm a sucker for all things James Bond so that's why I dig this hotel. Very swanky, hip and undeniably cool. With places like the Vesper Bar and Bond Bar, it's obvious they love 007 as much as I do.  I like:  1. The very central location of the hotel. It feel like you're in the epicenter of Vegas where all the action is. 2. Nice, modern, well appointed rooms, complete with hipster art books. 3. Full view of the shower and tub from the bedroom is great for voyeurs and kinks. 4. The terrace balcony to the Strip is great for flashers. 5. Young, nubile females roaming all over. 6. Marquee Night/Day Club  I dislike: 1. The shower was scalding hot and it was stuck on that setting. I ended up taking a shower in the spa tub. 2. The dealers cleaned me out at every table. It's unfair to hold this against them but I will cause it's my review. Went on the worst losing streak ever here. Very un-Bond-like. 3. The buffet gave me food poisoning. 4. People are dressed better than I am here, nothing is worst than feeling average.  The final score is 6-4 in favor of Cosmopolitan so I guess I'll stay here again. I'm already on the reservations page as I'm completing this review. I hope they give me some food voucher or a table at Marquee for the poisoning incident. Yacking and diarrhea almost ruined my trip, good thing I'm a party stallion."
5517,train,1,I enjoyed Lunch at the Hooters Cafe. I ordered the BBQ Burger and it came with curly Fries and my drink was a Iced Tea. The service was Very Good. and My Server was Jenelle. I left too full to get a dessert.
680,test,1,"I have mixed feelings about the Soho Met. On the one hand, it's a lovely little boutique hotel with good service, nice rooms and a great lobby bar that's pretty lively most nights. On the other, the location is terrible. Aside from a Chez Cora across the street, a corner store and a Starbucks near by, there really isn't much. It's close to the Sky Dome and the club district, which means it's noisy a lot at night, and not exactly on the urban side of things. If I was in town for business at the convention centre around the corner, then it would be a good option, but not for an extended stay. The area would drive me bananas."
6888,test,0,"i've pondered about this review for the longest time.  i'll be nice and go 3-stars.  my second stay here was definitely better than my first (where our room wasn't ready until 2 hours after we checked in).  yes, this is one of the newest hotels on the strip so everyone wants to stay here.  all the glitz...glam...bars...clubs.  yeah, it's all there.  but it's just all too snoody for me.  i don't like feeling out of place, and the cosmopolitan definitely makes me feel that way.  don't expect to find a table with less than a $25 minimum, even on off-peak hours.  for such a nice hotel, it's strange to me that there aren't any high end shops here.  but it's connected to the crystals shopping court inside aria so maybe that's why.  the walk next door was pretty convenient.    the parking structure tells you how many spots there are on each level, and those red/green lights above each spot to tell you where the availability is.  pretty helpful.  both times we stayed in the suites (aka terrace studio), which are pretty nice and spacious.  i'm sure the regular rooms are nice too.  i'm just glad both trips were free.  i wouldn't pay (or allow anyone i'm with to pay) to stay here.  psst....go find the secret pizza place (open late night only) on the 3rd floor next to the pool tables.  the line was uber long so we didn't try it, but i'm kinda curious how it tastes.  though i guess that late at night, when everyone's drunk, anything tastes good."
834,train,1,"Only four stars to start because I've only been here for 3 hours. So far, this brand new hotel is pretty nice. Like all of the Marriott brands, there's their brand identity for all of the frequent travelers to feel comfortable here. The rooms are spacious with a nice desk area...better than most hotels. USB ports are integrated into the outlets by the bed and at the desk. That's really great for me because I always seem to forget to bring the brick for my IPhone....which I did again during this trip. The interior design is clean and modern - the wood colors between the kitchen and living areas drive me a little crazy but that's my architect brain working. All in all - it's clean; it's new; it's comfortable.   Having a Marriott location so close to my client is great. I no longer have to drive in from the Residence Inn. Also, being in the heart of campus allows me to park my car and walk somewhere for dinner."
1652,train,1,Posh & Comfy... what more can you ask for?  Employees were extremely courteous... Loved our suite and stay..  For sure going to stay here again!
6301,train,1,Mike U pretty much nailed it. Very nice place. Great lounges and restaurants. Really enjoyed the ambiance and the Chandelier bar was pretty cool.
3074,test,1,"Alright, this place is clearly a bit older than some of the swankier places on the strip. But also significantly lower in price so that evens that out.   I had never been to Vegas and was driving through and decided to stay the night. So I had no clue the Hotel was located right inside the Fremont Street corridor, which was a plus! I maybe even enjoyed Fremont Street more than the actual strip.  +Free Parking in a garage with plenty of cameras. +Nice staff. +Clean room.  The casino itself was pretty boring and old looking but there were plenty of people having a blast. Anyway, I don't see why this place has low reviews on Yelp. When you're paying +-$50 for a big sized room there's nothing to complain about!"
6236,train,-1,"wow. i cant blieve i forgot to post on here. this has been a long time coming (went april/may 2011). place is fkn rediculously DURTY and DURTY FILTHY. we stayed here cuz we love marquee. little did we know...  it was friday @ about 9 pm when we arrived. 2 people in line front of us waiting in line to check in and 2 at the counter being helped.  There were literally 7 employees @ the check in counter walking around or on the computer. only 2 were checking ppl in.  10 min passed.  15 min passed.  20 min passed.  now there was 4 more ppl behind us in line. no employee says to the line ""we'll be right with you, or thank you for waiting."" no one bothers to look up at us, or even open at least antother check-in lane.  a ghetto lady in a wheelchair already at the counter, wants to get a room in the front for free and she does this pity party screaming and yelling and kicking and pretending to fall off her chair and is crying (i just COULDNT blieve she was handicapped, the moves she was doin), THE front desk girl (young and immature) ROLLS HER EYES at the lady and walks away to the back. then ladies and gentleman, wheelchair lady's so pissed, she walks up off her wheelchair and realizing what she did, she walks back to her wheelchair and then pretends to fall down.  The lady at the counter never comes back and we are waiting.  ok, they are dealing w/ a crappy customer, but give me a break, customer service was FUCKED UP making us wait half hour to get checked in.  everyone waiting in line was DISGUSTED.  our room wasnt ready (wth. 9pm). we had to wait 45 min.  UNREAL on the chandaliers and whole casino floor. feel like im in mariahcarey's nitemare. BLING bling... BLING.    fine. gave them benefit of the doubt as theyd just opened and probably still figuring out their shit.    check in. first thing i wanted to do was take a shower. 2 steps into the bathroom, i see black medium length hairs (i counted 10) on the bahtorom tile floors. SICK. Then I see one in the sink.  I got a tissue and wiped them all up and threw it away.  I step into the shower and i see a couple more hairs on the seat section in the back of the shower!!! UGHHHHHHHHH. nassssttty. i throw those out.  whatever. didnt think anything of it, probably forgot to swweep the bathroom. or the maid was shedding.  We go out, do our thing that nite, and i come back to sleep. Throw back the covers, and I SEE 3 black medium length hairs again (one under the pillow). OMG KILL ME.  but i was so tired i couldnt even call to complain. i picked up that shit w/ tissues.  i could barely sleep, so at 8am, my man still sleepin, i go to the front desk and i nicely (i swear, i was nice - the girl looked nice) tell this girl about these medium length hairs everywhere in the bathroom from under the covers.  but of course, this bitch had the nerve to look up at my head and say ""ARE YOU SURE IT WASNT YOURS?""  oh mother -  i had to restrain myself from crawling across the counter and beat her face in.  I say "" look at my HAIR its down to my waist, I hAVE THE HAIRS FROM MY ROOM SAVED, ILL GO DIG IN THE TRASH AND GIVE IT TO YOU, WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?""  she says ""no i dont need it"" and gives a dirty face.  i say ""YOUR HOTEL IS SO UNSANITARY AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT CHECK-IN YESTERDAY WAS SO UNBLIEVABLY UNPROFESSIONAL, AND WE ARE PAYIN FOR YOU SUITE AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF LYING"" she says ""well, do you want me to send a maid up to clean your place then?""  i say ""is that what ur offering me? to clean up? after we paid all this money to stay at your DIRTY HOTEL, I want LAST NIGHT comped "" she goes ""we cant do that. we can give you 50$ food credit""  i said ""get me your manager"" she comes back and says ""he says we cant comp your room"" omg i had to leave before i was about to rip her eyes out. ""give me $300 food credit."" i can do 150$. ""get ur manager"". She dissappears n says, $275. I took it n left. What the... Mgr can't address guests face to face? Too trivial for u?  F-u Cosmo.  we spent it all on their tacos. @ their restaurant called china poblano? The tacos were Amazing DELICIOUS (the hi-light of the hotel... as well as marquee.. and cosmo doesnt own marquee :) - both i give 5 stars, not reflected in this rating)  i love allsaints. they have one in there. sad. ppl r gonna be wearing that stuff who shouldnt be. Majority of cosmos clientele  trading in their affliction/ed hardy's for allsaints. yuck.  wicked spoon was what id been waiting and dying for.  sooooooo disssapointeddddd. bone marrow was steamed looking instead of roasted (gag). mac n cheez was good. thier ribs were nasty tasting and altho presentation was really nice on everything, they lacked TASTY FOOD.  i mean... i really dont know how to put it. they had good quality foods, but the chefs really missed the mark on flavor.  COSMO = failure of all failures  will only go into cosmo 4 marquee.  wynn/encore, please."
2150,train,1,"Let's be clear, I am here for a work conference and the company picked the hotel and pain for the room.  This is a pretty nice hotel.  The bedding is fantastic.  I have been sleeping really well here.  The bathrobe is excellent, I want to bring it home but alas they charge you $125 for it.  So it shall remain in Vegas.  The casino itself is much less smoky than most of the others on the strip and this girl MUCH appreciates it.  Right across the street from the Miracle Mile, it is about as convenient as it gets.    If you like burgers, make a stop at Holsteins which is also in the hotel - I am reviewing this one separately.  For pizza lovers, check out Secret Pizza.  It has no sign but staff can direct you to it if you don't find it on your own.    One important tip -- if you hear a mysterious intermittent beeping in your room, it is likely the secondary phone that is cordless and sits on a charger.  Mine would not sit stable in the cradle and so never charged.  Took me a while to figure out what it was and it drove me crazy for a couple hours.  I dealt with it by taking it apart and removing the battery.  My next step was going to be to smash it to pieces.    Also, my room did not have a coffee/tea station and I have to say I really missed this feature.  Bring your Starbucks Via and a mug if you find this lack of caffeine unacceptable.  Otherwise a coffee via room service is $6.  The staff was really helpful and friendly and I am really torn between giving it a 3 stars vs 4."
6358,train,1,"Not your ordinary Las Vegas Hotel!!!!  With so many hotels to choose from, choose Cosmopolitan! Stayed on the 69th floor. Room spacious, the staff courteous, the restaurants good!"
1137,train,-1,Went online this morning to book at this hotel-number shown was 800-206-4027 -dialed  number placed reservation to learn out later number was Priceline and not Marriott reservations-used my Marriott rewards card to find out will not receive points because wasn't done thru Marriott. Obviously Marriott does not check its websites for authenticity and I was overcharged too! Marriott websites are not trustworthy.
8996,train,1,"I was here on a work trip so I didn't pay for the room, but I know we only paid $100 a night.  For twice the price it would still be worth it.  They have 6 grills that are available to use.  They have an adult pool and family pool.  Also, most likely you won't spend a lot of time on the room, but they are huge.  Full kitchen and washer an dryer in the unit.  Enjoy!"
2516,test,-1,"its common knowledge that casinos encourage ppl to drink so we can spend more money, which is fine BUT when u need and ask for help,,, this hotel is indifferent and ignore u. really? i was lost because my friend had my glasses, cell, and wallet cuz i rode the zipline. so after not finding him ... all i could see was the four queens and i asked for help! i was freaking out cuz i couldnt see and i told them this. well,,the ppl in the cage and the security would NOT call my friend for me. the smug security pointed to some public phones! really? do they still exist? i didnt hav my wallet, hello? but they didnt care. perlita, a phillipino lookin lady just ignored me ! i was in need of help! thankfully a good samaritan called my friend to go get me. these employees are hateful, indifferent,, i told them i was handicapped without my glasses n they could care less. its so sad."
7002,train,1,"If I could live anywhere in Vegas this would be the spot. It has everything needed to have a good time and than some.   Every inch of the building is beautiful, swanky and funky all at the same time. With pink chandeliers, modern decor and cool furniture.   Our room was one of the best rooms I have stayed in. I slept better here than I do at home. I melted in the huge comfy feather soft bedding. The shower and tub were incredible. I love the CO Bigelow products that are supplied. I hate trying to use soap that feels like a cheap bar of wax.  The TV was command central for the lights, music, checking out the amenities and even making restaurant reservations for the places in the hotel. Anything your heart desires can be done through a remote, it is crazy!   The employees overall were nice and accommodating. The female that checked us in was professional and friendly.  The bell desk fellas were fast and asked about our stay. They also said to let them know if our shuttle didn't arrive that they would help us get to the airport. They gave me the ""warm and fuzzy"" feelings = great customer service.   Many different types of restaurants, shops, oh and don't forget Wicked Spoon (it is a must) to stuff your belly.   Yeah it's a cool spot. Thanks Cosmo for showing me the good life for a few days. Now, I'm back home a little fatter and poorer dreaming of my return."
1031,train,0,Si mangia discretamente l'hamburger Ã¨ buono ma non Ã¨ sicuramente il migliore che io abbia mangiato negli Stati Uniti .  You eat the burger is fairly good but definitely not the best I've eaten in the United States
6469,train,1,The newest property on Las Vegas Boulevard and quite classy at that.   The decor inside and out is modern and beautiful.   It has it's own feel of class and sophistication that many older casinos lack.   I'm sure that's in part due to the age and spacious interior.  Great casino and experience.
7922,train,0,"we were really excited for our girls weekend/cousin's 40th bday stay at the cosmo..pulling into the parking area was beautiful.it's so swank and modern. The entrance had grand glass doors and the staff outside was so welcoming. We were greeted by a front desk member who helped and directed us to their autograph lounge. Since we arrived in the morning we were not sure if we would be able to check in, since check in time is 3pm. The autograph lounge was very private, free beverages and the staff was nice. The man helping us somewhat hesitant to go beyond his normal customer service skills to assist us, but with some pressure from my sister he did and we were able to receive accommodations we wanted. Only one of our rooms were ready so we proceeded upstairs. The room had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show; which stinks(I mean it really smells like sewage) but was beautiful to watch at night. The room has two queen beds, which were very comfortable. The bathroom had a big soaking jet tub, very large shower area, two sinks at the vanity and a separate toilet area. The one thing we did notice is that their A/C system in the rooms seemed to be below standard, we had our a/c set at high at 65 degrees and still the room remained stuffy, we had to leave the terrace doors open for our whole stay. The bathroom had no ventilation and there was a set of blinds to use as a partition between the room and the bathroom where the tub was located. The mini bar had plenty of snacks and drinks. They had a small refrigerator and freezer, so we were able to keep our drinks cold. When my group was finally able to go into our room, I noticed hair in the tub and on our beds. My sister called to ask for assistance and we ended up with some comps due to the service downstairs and the long wait for our room(we didn't get out room tip after 4 when we were informed we would receive our keys within an hour of check-in and the 4 keys sent to us did not work, so we had to wait for another set of keys) but we were determined to have a great weekend. After our complaints were resolved, we set out to have fun. The decor of the hotel is so beautiful and sexy, but once again their ventilation system was lacking. The casino(I do not gamble, but others in my party did) was bogus, we went to the cromwell and they had lady luck. The Wicked Spoon buffet is a must!! The service is superb and the selection is a mix of various foods and drinks. We stayed at the buffet i believe for almost 2 hours, we had a great time trying different foods, talking and laughing. We went to the Marquee looking for the hip hop room but unfortunately was given the wrong information. The club was really nice, we enjoyed the outside where was the pool, cabanas and bar were located. Once again the water outside had a sewage smell; i smelled in it various locations of Vegas. The food from room service was delicious. My sister encountered some rude staff members when she had some requests, but once again we did not let it ruin our weekend. At the end of our trip I could not find my flip flops and security came to have me file a report and the hotel was going to reimburse me for them, i later found them in our other room and informed them, but i loved their emphasis to resolve all problems. Overall the hotel was nice and it was amazing weekend for all of us girls. OH ONE MORE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED..THE SECRET PIZZA SHOP ON THE 3RD FLOOR SO DELICIOUS AND PERFECT LATE NIGHT FOOD..and saturday night the restaurant across from the Marquee has a DJ that plays the best music..we ended our night there partying and having an amazing, fun night"
4598,test,-1,Where do I begin? So this place was recently re-modeled but it was more like it got new carpet and a half decent paint job. It is cheaper than anywhere else but you get what you pay for. The bathtub in our room had rust and the shower head was falling off. Two elevators where not working so it made it longer to get to your room. The room was Ok and the mattress felt new. Parking is free most other resorts charge. This place definately looks older even with the re-model. We where out most the time so it served its purpose but if you expect quality look elsewhere.
2263,train,-1,The food is DELICIOUS!   I had Hooters both Friday and Sunday this week...  There were some downfalls. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are really hungry. They take an extremely long time to bring you your food. I frequent Hooters in CA and have never had to wait as long as I did here. It took twice as long as the average wait time.  On Sunday I went to Hooters around 3am. There were only a few people inside and at least 5 empty tables. For some odd reason there was still a wait to be seated. There were plenty enough tables to sear everyone in line but they still made everyone wait. It was pretty ridiculous.   Though I love Hooters. I won't be coming to this one again
8438,train,-1,This place is not Lucky at all!! I played 6 machines from 25 cents to 10 dollar 600 bucks later never hit anything Staff isn't up on all of the hotel information I waited for two employees to finish their conversation at the 2nd floor bar to ask when the buffet opens to be told it's not actually a buffet you pay by the plate and then he went back to his conversation and I had to ask ok so when does that open to be told um I think it's 10 or 11 it should be open well it wasn't..... this place is far enough off the strip to not make it....
4878,train,1,"I'm basing my rating mainly on customer service.  During my 4 night stay, I had the opportunity to interact with several employees. People who work at the front desk, restaraunt, maintenence & engineering and phone operators. I did not gamble and I don't drink.  It wasn't until the day before my flight that I decided to read some reviewsand all I found was negative things. it spooked me, but still, everything was already paid for so I followed through.   I learned on youtube how to inspect a room for bed bugs when you get there. And how to prepare your belongings before you leave. Thankfully all was good. No bed bugs. At least, not in my room.  However!  When I got there my toilet was backed up. Gross! Picked up the phone and dialed 0 for the operator. There was no waiting time or music. An immediate answer. I like that. It only took the maintenence guy 5 minutes to arrive with a plunger. He had a good ense of humor about it. But the plunger wasn't enough so he went back out and in only another 5 minutes was back with a snake. Mission accomplished! He'd fixed it. He even insisted on finding something to make it smell good. More importantly, it stayed fixed.   He did return on Friday to replace the air conditioner that was only blowing hot air. It took me 2 nights to realize it because I rarely spent time in the room and so I hdnt tried to use it. Agan great service making the call, quick response time and a quick replacement time.  The restaraunt was great. I only ate at The Onion Grill because I'm not into the greasy party food places. And so yes, The Onion Grill had decent food at a bargain price. I'm consistenly focused on improving my eating habits sincee I've been engaged in working out with P90X, Insanity, RevAbs and now moving on to Body Beast. All available at FitnessCompensation.com And being that I was on a budget, it seemed just right for me. The service was always better than Id expected. Seated quickly and never felt rushed while I was at the table. The food tasted great and was delivered quickly.  Oh.. Before I forget.. The room had a few large stains on the carpet. Looked as if the room had been rearranged or renovated. The wood lining on the walls, the mattress and boxspring under it and the wooden furnature was all new. The rug wasn't new though, and I noticed it.  In a nutshell.. Despite the room needing a few fixes, which were handled promply. I enjoyed my stay overall. I slept well at night and left with a smile because I felt my business was appreciated there. and when I come back next year, I already know where I'm staying."
3869,train,1,"Alright. I'll be honest. I am kind of obsessed with The Cosmopolitan. Like...where do I even begin with this fine resort/EUPHORIC POWERHOUSE?!  --Lodging Accommodations:  **I stayed here for the first time back in October for my birthday, and we were lucky enough to snag one of their Wraparound Terrace Suites. Our party of 5 stayed comfortably in this suite, but we also added on a surprisingly comfortable roll-away. The room was obviously super luxurious, with 2 full baths, and a reasonably-sized kitchen with bar, microwave, freezer/refrigerator (tooootaaalllyyyy stuffed our liquor in these), etc.  The living area had a dining table for 4, coupled with a perfect wraparound (trend much...?), sectional couch that can sleep 2 smaller-stature people. The separate bedroom has the most glorious bed you will ever experience...like, ever (shout-out, T-Swift). I know that ""sleeping on a cloud"" is the cliche expression, but this is precisely what it felt like. We fit 2-3 on this each night (er...morning, technically), and 4 actually wasn't even that bad. And, of course the 500 sq. ft. terrace is the perfect touch on this suite-- there are 3 separate sliding doors surrounding the suite that all open up to the terrace. TIP: We stayed in the West Tower with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains. Some people may balk at the WT because it ""isn't right on the Strip,"" but trust me, if you have a fountain view: GET THE WEST TOWER. Why, you may ask? Well, the east tower's north face has the Bellagio Bell-tower/clock right in front of it; and, starting early in the morning, all you will hear every hour is GOOONGGGG, GONNGGGGGGGGG by the bell slamming around. Kiss that minimal amount of uninterrupted sleep good-byeeee. Our other friend with us had a Terrace One-bedroom in the East Tower and voiced her dismay with the loud bell-tower.   **My sister and I recently stayed in just their basic City Room over Thanksgiving break and were just as impressed. Very well-appointed rooms and MUCH nicer than Bellagio, which is typically more expensive!  FINAL NOTE: For lodging, don't hesitate to pick the Cosmo, even their most basic room. Gorgeous rooms with awe-inspiring views, luxurious bathrooms (oxymoron...?--maybe, but you know what I mean), and the best.beds.ever.  **SUPREME LOCATION. I don't know of anything else that can top The Cosmo for their prime location; with Bellagio right to the north and CityCenter south, you'll have all you need. Caesar's isn't too far, either (just north of Bellagio).  --Gaming  **If you aren't a gambler, then this will be pretty irrelevant for your desires to stay here. However, this is unequivocally my favorite casino on the strip...and for a plethora of reasons!  1) Machines to suit any player's palette. Several machines have competitive progressives. I last saw a $1 video poker machine at a progressive amount of $5,900 (normal payout=$4000 for a Royal Flush). 2) The dealers and pit bosses I have encountered have been typically friendly and personable. One of the last pit bosses I had, Barry, was probably the most congenial pit boss I've encountered.  3) I really like their Identity Players' Card system. Mostly for the fact that for every $1 you spend in the resort (spa, lodging, food & bev), you get 5 points! That's like $5 for every $100 spent. I'll take my 5% resort credit all daaay e'ry day.  4) Very neat roulette tables-- whichever number hits, all outside bets (and the given number) legitimately LIGHT UP on the table. This is a very nice feature for the beginning roulette player.  5) Well-lit, well-ventilated casino floor. It's right behind Wynn/Encore for smoke ventilation.   --Bars & Restaurants  **I either have current reviews for some places in the Cosmo (Book & Stage being one of them: http://www.yelp.com/biz/book-and-stage-las-vegas#hrid:uoTNNE0o67_BUiBRyUgNdw) or plan to write additional reviews (we have enjoyed D.O.C.G Enoteca and Scarpetta). The third floor has various fab dining options, and don't forget about the Secret Pizza for that late-night, post-Marquee, post-booze food! Speaking of Marquee...  --Nightclub Scene: MARQUEE  **Marquee Nightclub is going to be my next review, complete with tips (especially for us guys-- nightclubs love to nickel & dime us!) and handy-dandy info. For a true nightclub experience, Marquee will have you covered. Stand-by for that review! UPDATE: Here it is: http://www.yelp.com/biz/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas#hrid:D1rnDFtLao6aJts2xba5qQ   OVERALL: I love the rooms. I love the gaming, restaurant, and bar options. I love Marquee Nightclub. All in all, the Cosmo is THE place in Vegas right now and will continue to hold this status for a while with its hip and unique ambiance."
4537,train,1,"Honestly, you get what you pay for, so it cracks me up when I see 1 star reviews for staying here.  I stayed here back in October 2014 for Frozen Fury to see the LA Kings play at MGM Grand Garden Arena. Because of the weekend the rates jumped up to $92 (with taxes and resort fee through Travelocity) a night. It was the best deal out there!! We stayed one night, and I was pretty please with the hotel. The checkin staff were very friendly. Checkin is 4pm, but our room was ready a hour before, so it's good to ask!!! The girl was very quick with checking us in, and by 3:15 we were in our room. The room itself IS somewhat outdated, but it's Hooters and the theme is wooden Florida atmosphere. We had a nonsmoking double beds, which was perfect. The room itself was pretty clean, so I never saw any stains or anything. Their casino is small but it's nice cause it's quick to find where you need to go! The casino staff were very friendly as well. We ate at Hooters for lunch and also for breakfast the next morning! Sign up for the play club, because you get free play (I didn't win though, I suck at gambling) and $5 off a meal! Lunch was fine and pretty quick! I had a buy one get one wings, and basically it tasted like Hooters wings! The fried pickles were the best I've had at any Hooters. Breakfast was really good surprisingly as well! I had a Bloody Mary with mine! The convenience store is open 24/7, so you can get your Krispy Kremes and beer when you need it. Prices aren't bad at Hooters and the store. The Hooters girls are pretty friendly, except there was one who had a terrible attitude who worked in their Hooters merch store. You could tell she hated her job. Other than that though it was fine. Location is great because you are across the street from the MGM entrance. We spent a lot of time in MGM honestly. Fat Tuesdays is there also, along with 2 monorail entrances. Also very close to Luxor and Excalibur.  I am returning in mid March for spring break and I am staying at Hooters once again! I scored an awesome 2 night deal through Travelocity for $85! We will be spending time at Hakkasan and some other places! It's just a room honestly, and how often are you in it? It's cheap but saved you money for drinks and going out!"
4204,train,1,The show was excellent. She is unbelievable on the pole. Anywhere you sit is a good seat. Good value.
1904,train,-1,"DIVE, DIVE, DIVE.   The casino is nice, but the hotel, ugly hallways in baby blue and burgandy, beds were you can see where the part of the bed where your torso goes is noticibly lower than where your feet go.  Even on the 16th floor you are hammered by all the sound of the bands and people from the Fremont St. Experience.  No refridgerator in the rooms.  They have the nerve to charge you $3 a day for parking even though people who gamble there get to park for free.  Stay downtown at the Plaza, the Californian or the Golden Nugget, but not here."
5777,test,1,"My husband and I have recently returned from our second stay at The Cosmopolitan. We absolutely love it there. I love the central location as well as the balconies which are so unique to that property. I have never had anything but exceptional customer service there from front desk, to housekeeping, to the casino floor and the restaurants.   It is very easy making reservations with this property. We have booked through the Cosmo via phone and the service was above and beyond to find us the perfect room with the perfect view for our price-point. They were willing to offer us a special not advertised Angle Suite for a larger balcony (we had previously stayed in a wraparound and loved that size though we did not quite have the budget for it) though we ultimately went with the Terrace One Bedroom Premium View.  We arrived via cab and the bell desk was fantastic as always ushering us happily through the doors, helping unload baggage. They are so kind and willing to help either by checking your bags if your room is not quite ready (for early birds like us) or holding on to garments that are being picked up to be cleaned.   Check in was extremely fluid. We checked in at approximately one, there was not more than a five minute wait. Service at the desk was exceptional. We first inquired about a room in the East Tower but the attendant did confirm for us that is was a lower floor than what she had available in the West Tower which would put us very close to the strip and Marquee Club noise. We elected the West Tower room for privacy and did not regret it!  The casino is smaller than some properties, but as is the hotel and I have only ever felt that was an added benefit to the property. There was no shorter of games or cocktail waitresses for dirnks, a huge bonus in my book! The table minimums are relatively high on the weekends, but that is to be expected in the newer hotels, they are no more the Aria or Bellagio and this is not a hotel that should come to mind when looking at a tight budget.  I love that this hotel is full of lounge space, I much prefer that to clubs or bars with pricey covers. I am all about relaxation. From Vesper right at the check in area down to Bond with the lovely performing artists. Of course the central Chandelier Bar is gorgeous and always worth a drink there. Book and Stage is another great hangout right in the midst of the action.  It definitely has a younger crowd and feel which can sometimes be overwhelming (Ie the pools are very crowded in the summer) but I think you know that's what you are getting when you stay there. So much of this hotel is centralized, with the restaurants tending to be grouped together or the shops all grouped together. I enjoy that because I hate walking all over properties in search of a place to eat, then drink, then game.  The rooms are beautiful I have stayed in a Wraparound Terrace with a Premium View and this trip stayed in the cheaper Terrace One Bedroom with a Premium View and still greatly enjoyed the room. My one complaint is there was no dress in the One Bedroom which may be an issue for long stays, but with amble closet space and some shelving in the closet I was able to get everything stored away fine. I love the big chairs on the balcony and feel asleep out there on more than one occasion. The soaking tub in this room literally deserves a review all it's own, fantastically deep with a view of the fountains, it is literally impossible to find a better spot to relax, it's truly more of a mini hot-tub than a bath.  I will stay here again, I just love it!  Go for the Fountainn View, it is absolutely worth it and sign up for the Identity Program, those points add up fast!"
7888,train,-1,"Just spent two nights at this hotel, got a mixed feeling about it.  Great location, new and fabulous.  However, we found bed bugs in the room and we didn't get a room service.  1.  Check-ins: The gentleman who checked us in at the front-desk was really nice.  We didn't ask for any upgrades, he was nice enough to upgrade our room to a strip view with Bellagio Water Fountains without extra charge.  This is one of the top reasons I'm giving two stars instead of one.    2.  Bed Bugs I know it is hard to believe, but yes, you heard me right - we found bed bugs in the room!!!  My five-year old first found a moving object in the bed and she thought it was ""an ant"".  My husband took a look and found it's not an ant, but a bed bug!!!  We could not believe what we saw (this is a FIVE-STAR hotel and is very NEW!!!) and did a thorough check.  We found two more! We called the front-desk immediately and asked to switch to a different room.  Front-desk was VERY unfriendly AND impatient, put us on hold many times and cut us off without even let us finish talking.  Then they gave us a room without the view and said ""you should not have been given that room (the original room with view) to begin with"".  So we had to pack everything again and move to another room at 10:30pm - after a three-hour walk on the strip downstairs.  3.  No Room Service We did NOT get a room service!  We made sure not putting ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out because we really need it - with a five-year old, you know we really need that.  I'm hoping it was just a mistake, maybe caused by us switching rooms?  No matter what, it is NOT acceptable.  During checkout, we talked to a manager and told him what we have just experienced.  He was nice and friendly.  He was surprised and said they will investigate.  He offered free breakfast as an apology for what happened to us however we could not take it as we need to go.  He said we should have told the security once we found bed bugs.  However, how do we know that?  And why didn't the front-desk tell us that when we called them?    We are waiting for a response from the hotel.  I will update this post if I hear back from them."
2999,train,-1,"I've been calling for a couple hours now. Multiple times per hour, sometimes back to back for 10 mins straight and no one has picked up the phone. I would like to say this hotel has the worst customer service I've ever seen in my life. No one to pick up the phone for 5 hours (between 9 am - 1:45 pm?)? you've got to be joking! Honestly I would NOT recommend you stay at this hotel, book it online or anything at all! They make sure you pay 100% of the price of the room if you cancel too. BEWARE!!"
5643,train,1,"J'adore!!   It was my first time staying in this hotel but it had been on my bucket list for awhile. I swooped into Vegas to help out with a Yelp event and this is the hotel my boss-lady picked. As I was checking in the help desk was amazing and upon hearing that it was my first trip at that property they put me in a room facing the Bellagio Fountains. Truly the best view I've ever had in Vegas!! I totally instagramed the fountain show a couple times and even...sigh... took a couple selfies. I know. But it was such a cool room!   The hotel staff was always helpful and friendly, including the bell desk and valet. The taxi line moved quickly each time I used it and room service was SUPER friendly and delicious.   My room had a massive bathroom plus a sitting room, wet bar, lounge on the patio and comfy bed. Plenty of light and loved the decor... as I'm writing this I'm realizing that they might just be my new favorite place to stay!   It's also so convenient located-on the strip, right across from the Miracle Mile shops, and exit straight to a sky walkway to cross the street.   While I didn't love every dining outlet on site, the pool is top notch and I spent a morning there working. It seems small but there more than one on site and the sprawl out around the area into multiple corners and crannies.   5 stars all the way!"
9600,train,-1,"Came here on Friday, Saturday for a meeting. No parking....not even Valet! Despite informing the front desk that my meeting organizer had arranged for my parking to be billed to her account, the very unhelpful valet guy suggested that I go seek street parking nearby?! Surely for a hotel this size, there would be parking available?! Not impressed. Will suggest to organizer to seek place that will have parking for us attendees!"
4900,test,1,"#12 of 2017  I love the Cosmopolitan! This hotel succeeds in being beautiful, elegant, and fancy, without feeling stuffy and snooty. We walked around the hotel prior to dinner at Holsteins, and what I enjoyed most was the lack of overbearing cigarette smoke. The hotel had a nice perfume to mask the nasty stench of tobacco which I thoroughly enjoyed! Gambling here was fun, there is lots of parking (free) in the self parking lot off Las Vegas Blvd."
6093,train,1,"If I could put more stars, I would without hesitation. Cosmo is BY FAR my favorite hotel/casino on Las Vegas Blvd. The ideal Vegas experience will be found by walking into the Cosmopolitan, staying here (especially in a suite) is just a dream at its finest. So modern, so trendy, so Vegas."
4327,train,-1,I'm here for work and my company has about 50 rooms booked with this hotel and I called the hotel 2 days prior to put in a request for a balcony suite because I knew I was getting in late and they told me that they will put the note in and who ever is charge will take care of it . I get to the hotel and of course they don't have the room I asked for and they put me in a handicap room. What the hell ? Is this how you take care of a customer that has booked so many rooms ? Seriously . The hotel acts like every hotel room is booked and they have nothing else and to call back tomorrow .   On top of their amazing customer service the hotel is so run down . The towels look so old and see shower as well.   I called and asked to speak with a reservation manager so I would just talk to the other girl .   I won't be staying here again and I've already made sure that my company would not be giving them business again either .
9137,train,-1,I wish I could use a negative 1 but one star is as low as I could go  I drive all the way from out of state asking to check in early they want to charge $16 screw that I'll wait 2 hours  Finally get my room and when I go n there is a bag of groceries on the table next to the tv. And a full suitcase on the bag stand.  They gave me a room that already had somebody in it I'm just thankful nobody was in there because who knows what could have happened someone shoot me or kick my ass?   So I call the front desk and they say we will send someone up with key cards to a new room I ask for an upgrade to a suite which when I checked in they asked me if I wanted to pay $100 a night for a suite. HELL NO.   SO for their mistake they should have given me the suite. Or even a comp to the buffet but nothing the worst hotel I've stayed at here in Vegas. I usually stay at the Fiesta Henderson but thought same company and boulder station was a few dollars cheaper. Trust me CHEAPER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER  I Learned my lesson 2 more nights at this place and back home I go  I'll be back in September but already booked at the Fiesta never again will I come to Boulder Station again.   The bathroom even leaks water out of the shower head.    Needless to say I'm not having a very good stay this time. This used to be a cool place to come to would bring my mom here to eat and play all the time she loved it thank God she is not with us anymore to see how this place has fallen to pieces  -10 stars
4385,train,1,"The Four Seasons Las Vegas represents the top 5 floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel, with its own separate check-in, lobby/restaurant, spa, and gym. You get the best of both worlds--a quiet living space, but the convenience to all the hustle and bustle Vegas offers. Rooms are impeccably clean. There's a little bit of ""Vegas"" in the dÃ©cor with chandeliers, chrome accents, and color scheme, but it's still done very tastefully. Unlike most Four Seasons that give L'Occitane toiletries, this one gives the Etro brand. The spa/gym is seriously top notch. The gym is open from 6 am until 9 pm daily and located inside the spa area, which gives you access to the steam room (eucalyptus scented), showers (with fancy spa products), and the spa lounge. Turndown service is excellent and friendly. Had absolutely no complaints during my stay."
9189,train,1,"We really like this place. I am in Scottsdale 3 times a year on business. The staff is great. Online reservations, followed up by a personal email. Great reception and excellent bell boys. Nice pool area. Prado is great food. It is a resort so I don't need to leave. A big plus because I don't know the area very well. Valet treats your car like gold. All in all, great service and good food."
4077,test,-1,Giving this place one star is generous. First off we reserved a room with a king size bed and the reservation clerk guaranteed us that we would have a room on the same floor as our group if we let them know at the time of check in and told us she notated that we were coming with a group.  Well we get here and my husband and I got a room with two double beds. Second we gabled for over 3 hours and only received one drink during this time. The payouts on the games are pathetic to say the least. The service sucks and the girls working the floor are rude to other women. We haven't even gone to sleep yet the ac is not working properly. Don't even waste your time with this place.
9695,train,1,"6 girls. 1and1/2 bathrooms. 3 queen beds. Cosmopolitan pool.  Center Strip.  Friday-Sunday night.  $300.  You shouldn't need to hear more, but if you need more convincing read on!   The Jockey Club is a no-frills, convenient, and comfortable place to stay for your girls' weekend Vegas getaway.  Price was our most motivating factor, obviously, but for the price Jockey Club is way nicer and more convenient than, say, Imperial Palace or Circus Circus.  Our suite had: -3 queen-sized beds: 2 queens in the master bedroom and a queen sofabed in the living room - 1.5 bathrooms: full master bathroom and half bathroom - Walk-in master closet: this closet was HUGE! There was a safe, iron, and full-size ironing board in the master closet.  There is a secondary closet outside the bedroom as well. - Full kitchen: with plates, glasses, bowls, pans, baking sheets, coffeemaker, toaster, microwave, utensils, and salt & pepper  Tip: You can order groceries online (vons.com) and they will deliver it right to the Jockey Club!  (THIS INCLUDES BOOZE!!!!!)  The Jockey Club also has some sort of partnership with the Cosmopolitan (JC is literally behind the Cosmo) and visitors have FREE access to the Cosmo's 14th floor pool!  We took FULL advantage of this perk - just show the lifeguard at the Cosmo your room key and you'll be good to go!"
5022,train,1,"I've been to Vegas three times, this was by far the nicest hotel.  I ate at most of the restaurants and everyone was great.  My biggest problem with casinos in Vegas is the smoking.  Being from Ohio, I'm spoiled by no smoking laws indoors.  It's great!  The Cosmopolitan had the least smokey casino. Some other hotels I've visited by the time I got to my room my clothes were completely saturated with cigarette smoke and I couldn't stand to stay in the casino.  The Cosmo's restaurants are also located above the casino and are no smoking. This made it much easier to avoid that smell.  If you are a smoker there were a couple restaurants and bars in the casino where smoking was allowed.  Those however were not for me.  Seriously it's 2017, we've known for years that smoking will cause cancer, strokes, heart disease, and COPD.  Just quit.  Find a way and do it.    This was a great hotel, located on a great part of the strip, and a great place for a conference."
814,train,0,"Hotel Le Dauphin is in the prime of Montreal. The price plus location equals a decent place to stay in Montreal but let tell you why I rate it as decent.  First the rooms are nice! Modern looking, free wifi, LCD TV (no HD), stand up glass shower, 2 complimentary bottes of water and a computer in the room. We reserved a 2 queen bed room and that is what we received. The queen beds are very firm and the pillows are very soft. The only complaint I have about the room was the occasional sewage smell. We are not sure what caused it but it came from the shower drain. It didn't last long enough for us to notify anyone but it was strange.   The service was ok. For some reason our room wasn't cleaned on the first day, so I had to call for fresh towels, unfortunately it took two calls to get the towels.   We were not offered on site parking and we were told to park at the convention center. It is $22 dollars per day at the convention center.   The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast. It is not a full breakfast. It includes Montreal bagels, cereal, cheese, muffins, croissants, juice and coffee. Make sure to try their coffee, latte machine. It is pretty darn good.   Lastly check out is very simple, except they said I owed money for two phone calls. I did make two local calls which should be free. I objected to paying and then the clerk said she could not look up the calls to see what area code I dialed. We went back and forth and somehow she was able to look up the calls and indeed verify it was local. She removed the charges and checked us out.   The hotel is nice, but the service could have been better. I would stay here again."
9486,train,1,"I had a great stay at this Marriott, nice downtown location walking distance to many of Cleveland's attractions and restaurants/bars.  I was in town on business and our company hosted just over 100 people for 2 nights.  Check-in was simple and quick and my room was clean and well appointed.  I even thought the room smelled good when I walked in which was a great first impression.  It was ready for an early check-in at 12:30 which is not something that usually happens.  The good impressions stuck around and my whole stay was quite pleasant.    The hotel lobby bar Jake's was convenient and nice, the service was good and the Great Lakes Pale Ale on tap was delicious.  We used the conference rooms on the 2nd floor and had decent breakfast both days.  The staff did a great job, always there to pick up plates and re-stock the food and beverage items.  We also had a cocktail party one night and that also went very well, the food was really good and the house wine they offered was quite drinkable.    My complaints are minimal but worth mentioning - the internet as others have said is expensive and slow.  The airline check-in kiosk in the lobby would be great if the computer wasn't' sooooooooo slow.  Seriously I haven't seen internet this slow since AOL 2.0.  Also the security at the hotel is pretty non-existent, anyone could walk in off the street, take the elevator and be lingering around the halls outside the rooms.   I guess that is normal for many hotels but as a woman traveling alone I had to keep my guard up.    Upside were the baseball players roaming around shirtless, Boston Red Sox to be exact.  They were in town for a 3 night stint against the Indians and I guess they were using the gym or something but twice I got in the elevator with a shirtless player.  HELLO!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the downtown area.  The football, baseball and basketball venues are all within walking distance, as is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It would be better in the summer for sure, the first week in April was freeeezing!!"
3773,train,-1,"So you can change the name, but this is still the San Remo, stuck in time, It seems they haven't done anything to improve the rooms since that time.  CRT TV?  Check... Option to check out from your TV is non-existent.  The room itself is sparse, if you expect something, dont, If you get it, be excited, and I'm talking about simple things like a working coffee maker in the room.    Honestly, if you're going to Vegas and you want to save a few bucks, you're better off at Excalibur or Luxor, the little savings you get from staying here is definitely off-put by the distance from the strip and the lower quality of the rooms.  All-in-all, it's just not worthwhile no matter the savings."
5916,train,1,Absolutely gorgeous hotel!!! However I am taking one star off because for the price I expected the rooms to be a little more unique. However my favorite thing to do at this hotel is have a drink under the chandelier bar. So pretty!!
6719,train,1,Pretty nice casino but its easy to get lost in. I had trouble finding my way to the Buffet and had trouble finding my way back to the Aria. Im sure its harder than hell to find the hidden Pizza place even with directions.
3907,train,0,"To get the negative over with - don't eat here.  Luckily, there are plenty of options within walking distance.  The biggest plus of this place is the location.  I could see the football stadium from my room, and walked over to it and then down past the baseball stadium. Awesome location for walking and running, safe and scenic. Hotel is decent - but if it were not such a great location I may consider another hotel. Staff was ""okay"" - food was awful - room was fair but nothing fancy and not exceptionally clean or well maintained.  Bed was not very comfortable by today's hotel standards.  Did I mention the location is awesome though?"
8783,train,1,"I booked this room.thru Expedia. I was on a budget, it was extremely affordable, $350 for 7 days. My room is spotless, I had a full kitchen..even though I don't cook,  I felt like I was at home. Comfy bed, cool A/C, clean linen, bathroom was ok. It was quite, peaceful at all times. Pool was clean too and it was close to everything. Highly recommended"
1484,train,-1,"Gross, gross, gross!!!!   First of all, check-in took forever! Then there was no elevators. I asked them what about being handicapped accessible? And the front desk lady got offended and babbled something under her breath. Thankfully I didn't have my big heavy luggage or I would've been pissed having to carry it up the stairs...regardless, I feel piss for the people that did have to carry theirs.   Secondly, this place stinks and everything looks nasty!! I have never stayed at a hotel that looks so run down and overall dirty. The carpet feels so yucky but I didn't bring my flip flops. Ugh!   Honestly, if they weren't running a special, I wouldn't have stayed here. I'll suck it up since we're only staying a few hours, but I definitely will take a long hot bath to wash off the stench before I leave!"
9667,train,-1,"Fair hotel for a fair price.  Finding the hotel is a mystery itself. It's better to save your time and google map it cause it's really hidden especially if it's your first time there. It's like your driving in an alley. Also the enternce/exit too the alley is difficult cause there's so many people walking by!  The room was a decent size. It came with a full kitchen, living room, bedroom, 1 full bath and extra restroom. Lighting in there is horrible. The bed was ok. Hated the pillows, it was too big. The view was the worst, which was the wall of Cosmo so don't even bother on opening your curtains. If you have your privacy tag outside of your door they won't even bug you at all till you call front desk. But in my experience, at other hotels they would leave you a message to see if you need room service or any other amenities.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Check in was ok. On the last day we tried to do a late check out and we got denied. Never had someone denied us before. Their reason was that they had no more room.  Valet parking is $5 a day. Sometimes they are super fast and some times they are super slow at getting your car.   Overall, won't be staying here again. Only good thing I like from here that it was in a good location beside everything else, no thank you.   P.S. Don't bother with their wif, it sucks!"
3683,train,1,Great show! I took my two sons and had a great time. Jennifer is the brains behind this show. She has great talent and great looks. You can bring your wife or girl friend. Everybody had a good time. I was there May 24.
4758,train,1,"I thought balconies in Las Vegas were illegal? OH well, guess not!  My dad loves this place because he can actually smoke in his room, outside on the balcony without having the room smell of smoke, which is cool.  I'd definitely like to stay here more often, but it's pricey! And when I go to Vegas, I'm on a budget! Hopefully, one day when i'm BALLINNNNG! :)  Everything is just so new here, which is why I like it so much, and it's right across from PH, which is where Earl's of Sandwich is! BOMB! Cha-ching!"
480,train,-1,"We just got done having a stay-cation here for Memorial Day weekend. My husband and I where very disappointed with our stay!! When he booked it two months ago and we wanted to move the dates, they told him it was non refundable. We didn't book with any deals or special pricing so why wouldn't we be able to change it?They didn't even tell him that when he booked it.  We decided to go anyways because we would have lost over $600 for two nights if we didn't show up. THat's ridiculous!! I called for room service, they didn't sound so pleasant, in the least. To Valet it's $27 a day and to even self park it's $10 a day! The wait at Prado was over an 1 1/2 hours to get our food, when we got it it was still under cooked. There was a wait for everything. We stopped in to check out Joya spa and the front desk seemed very put out that we wanted to check it out before booking a VERY pricy service.WE decided against it because of the impression we got from the front desk.  It always seemed like you where putting out the staff everywhere we went. They charge for everything!!!! It seems like they are hurting for money to not even let you change the dates or cancel 2 months in advance then get treated like you are putting people out. This use to be my favorite place to stay-cation but not anymore. I will go elsewhere, where we are more appreciated!"
4680,train,-1,"Pleasant front desk staff is the only reason I give the hotel one star. Checked in late in the evening and housekeeping had plenty of time to clean. The shower walls had hair and a black ring inside the toilet bowl. Hair found on the toilet seat too. No amenities left at all not even a small bar soap! We ask for dishes and received a couple plates but no silverware. The Practical Comfort Packages would be delivered at 6:30 a.m. They weren't! No breakfast served because the food never arrived! The next morning, we found hair in the microwave. The front of refrigerator was dirty with stuck food. We ask twice to have our bathroom recleaned. Finally, the afternoon before checking out, it was cleaned. Dirty sticky kitchen area counters. It's spring break and we realize rates are much higher but this hotel is not worth half of the current rate. Our bed was clean and fresh towels placed in the bathroom to give the appearance that the room had been cleaned. The room was definitely not cleaned. Windows found unlocked and we were on the first floor! The Internet is non existent unless you pay for an upgrade to a faster speed. This place rips off tourists and tourists feed your local economy!"
2652,train,1,"I got married here not too long ago.  Everything was perfect.  The service, food (oohhh the food) and our wedding coordinator, Dennis, was the best we could ask for.  Sure did cost a pretty penny but I have no regrets whatsoever.  You know how some wedding couples are too busy to eat during the reception?  We were one of them SO the staff  cooked our main wedding entree (a trio of filet, lamb and tiger prawns) again the next day and brought it up to our suite free of charge!!  First class through and through. Amazing stuff."
5446,train,1,"My husband and I just stayed here to celebrate my birthday. I'm closer to 40 than 30, so we were looking to have ""grown-up fun,"" as opposed to the usual Vegas shenanigans. (though it looks like those can be found EVERYWHERE). We've also stayed all over the Strip- from the Four Seasons  and Wynn to the Luxor and MGM Grand, so were excited to try something new and upscale.  We had a Studio room with a fountain view that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the Strip and it was amazing. The room was great-- the perfect size- and we liked the open floorplan. The decor is lovely and we felt very at home and comfortable for the three days we spent there. Definitely book a room on a higher floor-- we were on 33 and I think I wouldn't want to be lower than 27ish for the view we had.  The check-in/out/front desk/concierge staff were all great-- as were our waiters in all of the restos where we dined. Everyone was VERY attentive and it seemed like that was a priority throughout the resort, sans the doormen- of which I actually never saw one (maybe they dont have??)  We got drinks at the Chandelier bar, which is fun and a very cool, unique idea. The casino is actually pretty small, but it was fun and much nicer than the places that seem to go on forever. They have interesting art to look at and the LED screen pillars in the lobby are a very cool touch.  We had an AMAZING dinner at Scarpetta. The food and wine were delicious and the service was impeccable. I LOVED our waiter!! We had a table for two right in the window facing the same Bellagio fountain-- I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner. I will definitely go back the next time we visit LV.  We grabbed a quick lunch at the hidden pizza place one day-- and it was DELISH. there was a long line out the door and no sign marking the place-- and you could see why. it's a definite must for anyone staying at the hotel... We had lunch at Holstein's the following day- which was a good place to go if you want upscale diner food. I'm a Veggie, so the burgers (which are apparently pretty good)- were wasted on me- but my onion rings and milkshake were quite tasty. :)  We spent one afternoon at the Spa and Hammam. I visit spas around the world and consider myself an aficionado of sorts, so was a bit surprised that I was disappointed with this one in the end. The decor is ok and the staff mixed-- the girls in the locker room couldn't have cared less as it related to ""service"" and jammed everyone visiting the spa into one area of the locker room so we were all on top of one another. My husband and I BOTH noted that they also should have a clock or two in the spa, so you know how much time you have before your treatment appointment. I was also given the wrong size shoes and robe and it was also VERY messy-- there were open/used lockers and towels dropped on the floor or draped on doors in every corner, as well as an overflowing wastebasket of water bottles in the jacuzzi area. kind of gross...  we got a couples treatment in the Hammam, which was actually beautiful inside. the room itself felt very natural and modern at the same time and the heated stone is VERY cool. Our treatment (Red Flower Hammam Experience or something like that) wasn't at all what I expected from the written or verbal description I received (a bit lack-lustre) and IF we were to go back (which I probably wouldn't)- I'd opt for a massage with an add on scrub instead. I hate leaving disappointed and not relaxed-- especially after dropping $700 in about 2 hours- but hey, it was an experience and you have to try to know.  the only other fault we found with our otherwise delightful Cosmo experience is the ""dog-friendliness"" of the hotel. As all of their commercials feature Great Danes (and other animals), we assumed it was a dog friendly hotel. It turns out it is- if your dog weighs less than 20lbs. Ours is about 10lbs, so it was fine (though I still think it's weird they show giant dogs in the elevator in those spots!)-- but the hotel ISN'T really dog-FRIENDLY. The Four Seasons and W chains offer in-room services and even menus for dogs-- they have dog beds, bowls, toys and leashes waiting in your room when you arrive or send them up- and offer pet-sitting and special treats, etc.-- but there was NOTHING at the Cosmo. As its Vegas, and there's nowhere to really TAKE your dog ""outside""- they do have a dog run-- it's about 3ft wide and 10ft long. With as much real-estate that this place has dedicated to everything, we were REALLY surprised that they didn't have a grassy area where guests could sit and play with their dogs-- even a 12x12ft space would do, considering the dog size restrictions. Actually-- it would be GENIUS if they had a place that was a dog store, daycare, grooming and ""park"" area, as people pay big bucks for these services and I'm sure clients and locals alike would LOVE it.  Anyway-- that's my novel of a review on our stay at the Cosmopolitan... all in all, I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10."
9206,train,1,I cannot say enough good things about this place. The property is stunningly gorgeous and the service is absolutely flawless.
568,train,-1,"First, let me start by saying that our tour guide was absolutely phenomenal she was very knowledgeable and nice my problem is with the company itself. First none of the stops are labeled and when you ask where the stop, is you are directed all over the place and nobody can give you a clear answer. We needed to redeem our vouchers and the employee called the nearest stop to let the person know that we were coming but the person left their stop and even after waiting 40 minutes, the employee never came back. All together, we waited for an hour for the bus to come and every time we called their customer support line, we were told 5 more minutes. The bus is very old and hot and you can barely hear the tour guide because the system is very crappy and it keeps cutting in and out. Overall, I feel then my money would have better be spent somewhere else. This company needs to make sure that their employees are all on the same page and that they know what is going on as well as making sure that all the stops are labeled from the strip so the people do not have to run around in 117 degree heat to try to figure out where to go."
686,train,-1,"I am only giving two stars bc the decor and vibe here looks nice. Otherwise it would get 1 star due to the fact that they have construction and dump / trash trucks beginning as early as 630am And scattered through the day. Being on a shoot schedule with odd hours, you stay at 5star hotel expecting a certain level of quiet and comfort. Don't count on it here. They apparently can't do anything about their engineers drilling right above your room during business hours. Sounds like it's right in the room with me. Currently sleep depraved and overly exhausted. Seriously not cool at this $ tier.  If they reimburse us on our room charges to ease the pain I'll change my rating. But until then - 2 stars is gracious."
7924,train,1,When I grow up I want to stay at the Cosmo. This place is the sexiest casino/resort on the strip and has the best looking people as well.
9086,train,-1,My girlfriend contracted a skin infection from taking a hot bath in this hotel. It took several visits to the doctor and meds for the infection to disappear after 6 weeks. We blame it on the sanitary conditions or lack of in the bath tub.
6199,train,-1,"If i could give this place a 0, I would!  Long story short, money was stolen from our room and the hotel claims they can't do anything about it. So what's the point of staying at a high end place when they can't even protect their rooms?!?!  Shadyness under all the fancy crystals in the building...and i've read and heard this happens often.  I'll stick to Wynn, thank you."
9115,test,-1,"I go to this casino regularly sometimes I win , but usually loose ! I had spent 100 , Friday night couple night before $497 , Friday I had about 7 dollars in change from cashing tickets , I went to cashier and ask Mary to change it for me , money that it was going to go back to the slots ! She refused ! I ask to speak with sup,  Michael he came to the window and also refused to cash my change ! I went to couple of employees from slots , they were very nice told me they were different from cashier ,  it made me so angry that all the money that we leave at this casino and they refused to change 7 dollars in change !"
4254,train,0,"I stayed here for a few days while in Vegas.  We had four people and it was perfect for us.  There were two bedrooms, a kitchen, balcony, and two full baths.  This resort is an apartment complex that has been remodeled and turned in to timeshares.  They had  a shuttle that drops you off at Caesars Palace, which is very convenient, especially because it ran every half hour.  If you have chance to stay here, I would recommend it."
2526,test,0,"Met one of my friends from California that is staying in downtown LV while he is out here house hunting.  He suggested meeting up for dinner at Four Queens, which I honestly have never heard of, so I was game as the adventurous Yelper that I am.  Parking was pretty easy at 7pm weekday, but I noticed that the garage was full on the 3rd level when I left at 9:30pm.  Plus the other people in the elevator on the way up were all parked on the 4th or 5th floor.  So I guess the locals that frequent Fremont Street in DTLV are aware of the 3 hours of free parking with a validation stamp (got mine from their Magnolia's Veranda restaurant).  Taking their garage elevation down was a little disorienting for me.  When I stepped out and looked around, I thought I was on the wrong floor (still inside the garage).  But you just have to turn left and head towards the casino entrance at the bottom of the ramp.  The casino itself is small, much older and fairly saturated with the ghosts of long dead and dying cigarettes.  Pretty typical of the smaller, more vintage local casinos.  However the draw are lower limits for table games, plus better odds from the slot machines and the fact that you can exit directly onto the middle of Fremont Street Experience directly from the casino.  One of their restaurants (Magnolia's Veranda) is their version of the casino cafe.  The food is decent for a nominal price.  Perfect for filling your empty tummies without depleting too much of your bankroll for the gambling portion of your Vegas casino vacation or staycation.  (Sprint subscribers will have crappy signal and data reception in here, which is just an FYI)."
4674,train,-1,"Terrible management.  Had 7 rooms ""reserved"" only to be told upon arrival that they didn't have but three rooms left.  Reservations apparently mean nothing here.  Front desk staff is clueless.   Much better options for hotels in this area. Avoid."
5793,train,-1,"Nice strip hotel with the usual bells and whistles.  Atrocious housekeeping standards - switched 3 rooms in 2 days - first one was filthy and smelled of smoke, second one had AC not working, 3rd room had no shampoo and washcloths, and AC was weak again.  You can set the AC to 65 but the rooms never get below 74ish.  Management and staff doesn't really care.  Avoid."
6218,train,1,"This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. It's new and very modern in decor. The atmosphere makes you want to stay, but there are so many people wandering around that it it can be difficult to appreciate.  The conference center is nicely appointed, very spacious, and functional. Hands down, it served the best breakfast and lunch options I've had at a conference.  For dinner, I highly recommend Jose Andres' Jaleo for delicious drinks and Spanish tapas."
7732,train,1,"My experience at the Cosmopolitan was a complete fluke. My mother and I walked in because my younger brother had stayed there for Spring break earlier in the year and we just wanted to see what it looked like.  Firstly, the lobby of the casino is absolutely gorgeous. After doing a lap we were going to head out to our next destination, but I noticed a $10 black jack table and decided to sit down and play just ""a couple of hands.""   What was supposed to be a ""pop by"" turned into a three hour gambling extravaganza. The two dealers that rotated back and forth at our table didn't mind giving hints to players  (making the game very fun instead of intimidating which is sometimes can be) and the servers came by to offer libations on a regular basis. After three hours of the most fun I have had gambling EVER we decided to quit while we were ahead and ended up leaving with a nice little chunk of winnings.   I will definitely plan visit the Cosmopolitan again on my next trip."
7227,train,-1,"I booked a room in advance, but because I had lost the card I originally I almost didn't get my room. I understood their position on it, but having prepaid and they taking my money, it would seem to me that that would be that. I instead had to get money from the ATM which charged me 30$ to do so, and thankfully I brought enough cash to cover, otherwise I would have had to turn around and drive back the 221 miles as the rest of the hotels were booked....The hotel staff didn't seem sympathetic at all, all they wanted was their money, which they already had.  My new card, was linked to the same account, same name, same everything. They could have called and verified, I was also told that I could use a different card for the incidentals when I got to the hotel. Regardless, I took the money from the ATM and paid them but told them I didn't have cash or funds for food because that was the last of my money. They gave me a 25$ food/bev credit (ok one meal for me, and not for both of us), they also comped the resort fees (considerate, considering the pool was closed anyway and I couldn't even get in the spa if I wanted).  booked the one-bedroom terrace suite with fountain view.  Aside from that, the room was dusty, blinds for the tub didn't work (called for maintenance, they told us there were no more cranks in the hotel (why with all the hotels around being automated that that one still has cranks?), the room was really dark (didn't see the near microscopic light dimmer), and they placed us on the 22nd floor right above the fan from the Jockey Club so when you were outside, you could only hear that. The other problem was the front door, had to crank it so hard and push your whole weight into it just so itd shut. The second day, Security came by to inform us the door wasn't secure. We told them about it being stuck all the time and you had to really pull/push to get it to shut. The mini fridge is so full of THEIR stuff that you can't even put a water or soda in there to get cold. The room layout in the living area was kinda not to my liking just because you had to tilt the television toward the couch, but it didn't go all the way so you had to sit at an angle to see it. The CAT cable for the internet didn't work, so I had to use the wifi, which wasn't that great as I could not stream anything on Hulu. The good part was the TV's were smart TV's and could connect to those apps anyway, but I didn't want to put in my info.   The other thing, my husband picked up a can from the pressure plate, not having had to deal with being charged for moving an item in a hotel room, and not more than 3 minutes later we had someone at the door asking us what it was we had moved and that they had to check we didn't open it. Even though my husband put it back.   The things we did like about the room was the bathtub, Japanese soaking style, and we liked the balcony, even if it was noisy. We also really loved Wicked Spoon, really best buffet in vegas. 5 Star quality food, decent price.   I honestly don't think I will stay here again, because of the above things, the lobby smelling like someone is getting a perm, the staff, and the fact that I just wasn't that impressed. Much more impressed by the staff/hotels of MGM.   I was told upon check out if I emailed the manager next time they'd ""hook me up"" but I donno if itd be worth it."
8718,train,1,Will be staying here in a few weeks! Hoping to post a positive experience here...Customer service is more important to us than a super fancy place. Gotta love the free breakfast and happy hour!!  Gonna post a five star..hoping they will deserve it!!
2553,train,0,"Didn't attend for a conference, nor eat at the hotel.  We spent Valentine's weekend at the Wyndham - Friday and Saturday nights. It's clear that the quality of stay is based on events at the hotel and room assignment. The dance competition did overflow the lobby and ballroom floor quite a bit, but I didn't find that to be much of a distraction. The only aspect of the crowd that was a problem was checking in on Friday  - the check-in drive was about eight deep with SUVs and there was no way in. We just parked in the garage across the street (east) and things worked out fine ($22 per day max).   We were up on the 20th floor, river side, all the way on the eastern end, so our stay was very peaceful and quiet. Or companions were on the 10th floor, near the elevators, which was clearly full of more bustle, but not horrible - or so they say. The location and view is unbeatable. The rooms are smallish, but nothing worth a downgrade. Bathrooms are small, but we manage to not get ready at the same time so it wasn't an issue. Our room was very clean, great showers, very nice beds. The place could use a bit of sprucing up, but we were very happy. Also, we booked on priceline for $75 a night, and that makes everything nicer."
8925,train,0,"I need to preface this with I'm not a gambler so I wasn't really impressed with this place. I was in town visiting family and they took us here for the dinner buffet. It was very very smoky!   The buffet wasn't bad but the line was a little long. The food was decent, it could've been warmer but you can't really expect hot at a buffet, I know. The service wasn't bad. I can't say that when I return to Vegas that I'll go back to the Boulder but I have the experience."
6281,train,1,"I'm a local here and going to the strip can be a hassle, however I always love going to the Cosmo because they have everything to offer. They have valet so you can bring your own car (although sometimes it's full so you have to self park) and their entrance is beautiful. They have a beautiful lobby where they have the gambling and one or two restaurants and they have a bar called the chandelier bar it's 2 stories high and quite expensive but worth it. They have some delicious restaurants and also some quick places to eat like egg slut. The rooms are stunning and very private, there open and the maids keep it very clean every day. They have a couple pools and they also have a day club with a pool.  I really love this place I always find something new here when I come and I love taking my friends here!"
8693,train,-1,These people tried to charge me $25 per additional person when I had a room that sleeps 6. It was my birthday and I do not appreciate being asked for more than $200 for one night to have a safe sleepover with my girls. I will not be staying here again when other hotels are cheaper to begin with and won't hassle me for wanting my friends to stay the night and not drink and drive.
5049,train,1,"GO GO GO GO  What the Vegas experience should be like! New, Glamorously Hip and Awesome Service. 3 day conference, went smooth rooms were awesome. Pool party rocked! Corporate catering and beverages better than many high-end strip offerings."
449,train,1,"The Family came in town this past weekend but before they booked they were looking for a good recommendation. It was going to be my brother who is lower 20's my mom and my grandparents. So I was thinking middle of summer grandparents who aren't going to hike camelback by any means where would be a good spot? Montelucia it is!   First off they got a great deal which added to the value. In regards to their stay they couldn't have been happier. The amenities were top notch. The happening pool was just the right amount of craziness that didn't turn off my grandparents but kept my younger brother happy. On Friday nights they have a live band which was great. All in all a somewhat great experience.   So like I said earlier they got a great deal through Expedia. This is where the Montelucia loses a star. When my family was checking out they hit them with a number of ""resort fees"" which in the end totaled up to another $100 or so dollars. It was a crazy amount but still the principle that they weren't expecting that.   However with that being said I would recommend the Montelucia due to their service, amenities and dedication to being the top resort in PHX."
9794,train,-1,Do not stay here!! I have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel! First we had booked a room online about 3 weeks prior to staying and had a confirmation number as well. When we got there they had not saved the room for us even when we had the confirmation. Then we asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes but it's going to be $350 verses the room you booked which was $200. You would think you would accommodate us based on the rate we had booked before! Also the rooms were absolutely disgusting!! As you can see in the photos below. The bathrooms were small and also extremely dirty.
2720,train,-1,"Beautiful hotel, only the service was horrible, the room was dirty, they charge for everything, and it claims to have the best pool in vegas?  Please!  Upon arriving, I paid for the $50 a night upgrade that gave us a bigger room.  We were placed into a room that was recently cleaned.  However, there were glass shards in the restroom, drug-like substance on a book against the tv, icky stuff on the floor, change that was left on the counter, everything was wet in the room, and there was a nasty white stain on the bench against the bed.  I was astounded!  They did not apologize for the inconvenience, but instead moved us to a room that had no AC!  We were there in July while it was 110 degrees outside.  I called for toilet paper at 6 pm and they said that i had to wait in line, so it did not come for an hour.  I found online that this hotel had the best pool?  It was beautiful, but teeny tiny.  There is not enough room for everyone to lay in the ""popular pool"" there were limited free chairs.  I would not come back or recommend this place to anyone.  Come inside to look around but don't waste your money."
5642,train,1,"According to one of our cab drivers when we were in Vegas, The Cosmopolitan is one of the new hotels on the strip and I must say, it's really an impressive building inside and out.  I love the Chandeliers. They sparkles and they are such major BLINGS. I can just stand there and just admiring those pretty bling bling bling. They have different shops than other hotels on the strip which is a big plus. It's kinda tiring to see the same shop over and over again on Vegas strip, The Cosmopolitan is definitely a breathe of fresh air."
8640,train,-1,"After spending 15 mins or so on the phone with the CSR from Hotels.com, the time spent finding a room of which I was asking, kudos for that.   I got to the hotel it was a different story I didn't get what I asked for. I went through 3 rooms before I made my decision to stay here. The first room I was amazed how clean but didn't have a bathtub of which I requested and so I went back to the service desk to request a room with a bathtub. The girl at the desk apologized and said, she confused me with the lady behind me in line, what?! How is that?   As she was searching for another room she stated, that the housekeeping left for the day and not all rooms were cleaned, my arrival time was around 7pm on a Sunday. I found that to be an odd statement.   Anyhow, the second room was horrible!!! I walked in it seemed like someone just left the room it smelled badly, the couch cushions were thrown together ie zippers in front and indents on the couch as if someone was laying there and got up quickly and left. I turned on the lights in the kitchen and baby roaches scattered amongst the kitchen floor I stepped on one as I left the room, not good!!!   I went back to the front desk to inform the desk clerk she again was apologetic. Finally I got a room on the 2nd floor not of what I requested because I spent 15 mins or so on the phone with Hotels.com requesting for the first floor as I had injured my leg and had a hard time walking. I took the room on the 2nd floor (it was clean) but was feeling uncomfortable at the previous room and the sight of the roaches that I didn't sleep soundly.   Altogether the place was mediocre for the price, if it weren't for the hassle and the roaches I'd stay again. I was still in awe about housekeeping leaving without cleaning all the rooms, that is just wrong and makes the hotel look bad, I experienced it!!! hmmm smh  I guess the housekeeping crew have the, ""I don't give a damned attitude"" about their jobs.  Safety issue someone should walk the premises a few times a night, with a broom. I had to walk in a flowerbed because there were puddles of water in the walkways that could clearly be broomed away as I almost fell in the flowerbed, no other way to get around the walk area. Morning came and no puddles..."
2712,train,1,"Love staying at this hotel. The gigantic chandelier bar as you enter the hotel is really classy and the assortment of restaurants on the 2nd floor is great. It includes Scarpetta, Momofuku and Eggslut. The rooms are pricey, usually in the $300-400 range and the blackjack tables tend to be $25. Once in a while, there are $15 tables. In terms of location, there's a cheap food court just across the bridgeway which is convenient. It's located right on the strip unlike Vdara and Aria."
166,train,0,"This place is good for the price. The only real downside is the location. This is our first trip to Phoenix and we knew nothing about what parts are good/bad. We made last minute plans and were on a budget. I felt totally safe inside but my husband was propositioned by a suspect looking female asking for a ride across the highway, someone's truck parked literally 20 ft from our car and room was stolen, and there were some other questionable looking individuals out in the parking lot (and adjacent lots) frequently. We have 2 kids under 4 so this is not ideal. All and all the staff is great, value is good, place seemed pretty clean. Probably won't return but solely based on location reasons."
4922,train,1,Breathtaking hotel!  Might be the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in Vegas.
353,train,0,"I would go back and give them another chance. We set the bar high and were looking for a 5 star resort experience and it missed but not by much. I was with a high maintenance group though too. We think after being bought by the omni it has changed, integration problems maybe. So I think they just need to tighten up a little which hopefully they do because it's a nice property with great scenery and views.   Spa was a great value though, only $25 for a day pass. Steam room is roasting hot, almost unbearable which is how I like it.   The day beds on the patio were awesome for lounging and having your morning coffee and catching some sun.   Didn't eat there either. Great location, close to camelback and Scottsdale, etc."
191,train,1,"Not cheap, best rate I could get was $150.00 for a 9 hour stay between flights, but if you're ok with that money (I was), you won't find a better location for YYZ airport.  Connected to Terminal 3 via a short walk and Terminal 1 by a 90 second free train ride you'll never be late for your flight.  Huge rooms with very comfy beds and a great shower.  Widescreen TV's were nice, even if small for the distance.  Staff was very friendly and helpful."
2930,train,-1,"We chose Hooter's because we and 24 others were driving from SF to Las Vegas with classic hot rods in tow for a car show in Vegas, and Hooters was the only place that guaranteed us rooms together. Too bad they lied and our group was all over the place.  Wish that was the worst of it, but no. The worst was the raw sewage they pumped out of the place 20 feet from the rooms. The putrid stench got into every pore and was the most disgusting thing you could ever imagine. Vomitting for all the wrong reasons makes this place a health hazard.  Then there were the elevators that left you out on the wrong floor, that is, if they happened to be working at all.  It was a guessing game because Hooters never put an out of order sign up. Wanna guess how long it took to get up to your room since only 1 elevator was serving 18 floors of rooms in the Bayview Tower?  Taking a shower was a hoot too. About every 40 seconds you would get blasted with a scalding shot of hot water, or an absolutely freezing shower of water. It turns out this is a long term problem they have known about, but refuse to fix. (That goes for the elevators and raw sewage issues too. They know, they just won't fix it.)  Hotels I have stayed at in 3rd world countries haven't been this awful. To think this is an experience out of Las Vegas, NV is unimaginable.  ."
5557,train,-1,"I've now stayed there 2 years in a row and definitely won't stay a 3rd. The mad onion restaurant is so bad I only did that one year, lucky for me.  For all the money the hooters corporation has they sure don't spend any of it on this hotel of theres."
2916,train,1,"Good hotel for the price, great specials going on. The hotel itself wasn't the greatest but for the price you pay you can't expect much. The location was good and right across from the mgm! Customer service was awesome here!! Hooters bar inside the casino could have had better service."
7608,train,1,"We fly to NYC several times a year and we stay here every time we're in Vegas. The rooms are well designed and large. Every room has a terrace, most with great views. The Casino is a bit small compared to those at MGM or even Harrah's, but we don't gamble that much so it's not a deal breaker. But the tables and slots they do have are well maintained and very nice.  The restaurants are probably our favorite part. Eggslut, STK, the secret pizza place are always good. But our favorite is Milos. In the 8 years we've stayed here we never bothered to stop into this restaurant until this trip. It's better than most restaurants in NYC. It's simple Greek food but done exceptionally well. They have a prix fixe lunch special for $29! You get an app, entre, and dessert. Normally this would be around $60. It's an insanely good deal. But the food is just phenomenal. Try the octopus app and the tomato salad. And the yogurt dessert is the best choice. We went three times during our last stay because we couldn't get enough.  The hotel is sort of centrally located. Nearby the shops at Aria and walking distance to Bellagio and even Cesar's Palace. As a hotel guest, you get a complimentary ticket to Marquee. It's worth $40 at least. On some holiday nights, they up the cost to $100. It's a great deal if you like going to clubs.  We also recommend signing up for the Identity membership so you earn points. Each year, we get a free stay.  Overall, best hotel in Vegas for the value. We love it."
8749,test,-1,"I stayed at this hotel on 6-9-12 and had a very bad experience. I reserved 4 rooms on 5-14-12. When we arrived there were only 2 rooms reserved even though I had a confirmation number and was billed for 4 rooms. I spoke with Mike who was an assistant manager, he got us 2 more rooms and said he would look into the problem and call me when he figured out something. Mike called me about 20 minutes later and said he worked out a solution. He said there would be a $37 charge for amenities which I said was fine. About 15 minutes later I got a text from my credit card company saying there was a $172 transaction charged to my card from the hotel. I called Mike and asked him what was going on. He said it was a pending transaction for amenities and would not be charged if nothing was used or missing from the room. I told him I was already charged $37. He said he could not do anything with the charge until we checked out and closed the ticket.  Now as for the rooms, one of the rooms would not cool properly and the shower rod and curtain was missing so one of us were moved to a different floor. The other 3 rooms a/c did not work very well. It was only 99 degrees that day so I am glad it did not get any warmer as the a/c would have been inadequate as we had them on max. The suites are a little larger than most suites which was nice. The full complimentary breakfast was nice also. The overall appearance of the hotel is dated and needs some work. I paid $89 per room and would not advise anyone to pay more than that for their 1 bedroom suite. Upon checkout we spoke with Dennis and told him of the previous charges and I asked him for a receipt showing that nothing was owed. He said he could not do that. I asked why he stated his system would not allow him to do so. I asked him if he could not give me a receipt I wanted the $172 charged to my card credited back, he said he could not do that either. I told him I wanted something showing that I had no balance with the hotel. He said he had no way of doing that. I said I wanted something because I not want to have to dispute charges with the credit card company. Mike said he could give me a copy of the screen off his computer system, at this point I said fine. I then asked for a manager and Dennis said he was an assistant manager. I then asked for the general managers name who Dennis gave me the name of Tom Silverman. When I got home I left message for Mr. Silverman and have yet to receive a call or email from him. This hotel did not meet my expectations. If you plan to stay there don't expect much."
6047,train,1,"New favorite Vegas hotel!  The hotel is always bustling, never a dull moment.  Love the restaurants inside the hotel."
6918,test,0,"I really wanted to love this place but my first impression of everything was not so fantastic. I called ahead to ask if they had a check in time, 3pm. Our flight was landing at 11 so they said if our room was ready, we could go in right away, otherwise, the bell desk would keep our luggage safe. It took FOREVER just to check in. The service was ridiculously slow. There were two lines for any front desk service. They didn't differentiate between people checking in or out. There were maybe 3-4 people/groups in front of us and it took around 40 minutes to talk to someone. Our room wasn't ready yet and I didn't mind. I know it's early so that's fine. We had booked a package deal that came with $50 dining credit so we figured we might as well eat lunch here. They gave us room keys and said that we would get a call once our room is ready and we could just head up to the room with those keys. Since we didn't have a room number, I asked if we'd still be able to eat at the buffet and charge it to our room to use up that dining credit. Yeah, sure..no problem. They can look it up by name. (We get to the buffet and this is totally not the case.)   We eat lunch, go shopping...kill time. Still no call. By 3, I was getting pretty irritated since my feet were hurting from walking around and I just wanted to plop down in a soft bed. We head back to the desk to ask about our room and ta-da...they assign us to a room. So our room was ready...but we never get a call? Annoyance #1.  We finally get to our room and the bathroom door handle is broken. Broken as in you can't lock it and every time you tried to slide it shut, it would fall out. Awesome. We call the front desk to inform them. We're not too picky, but we called just to make sure we wouldn't get accused of breaking it later on. You would think they'd notice that stuff like this is broken...  Next, we try to connect our iPhones to the connectivity panel on the desk to play music on the TV. Won't work. I tried to control the room functions via the TV as well. Didn't work either. I was starting to get pretty irritated. I ask the hotel to fix it and they send IT up to our room. It takes him awhile to fix it, but it finally works. He also said that connecting your phone to the panel doesn't do anything but charge it and you have to use an auxiliary cable, which they normally provide, but are completely out of. Great! What's the point of that whole panel then? Annoyance #2.  The shower was annoyance #3. I tried taking a warm shower and the temperature would not stay steady. I'd turn the knob up a little to make up for the chill in the water and it would turn scalding hot. Turn it back down, it would be warm for 2 seconds before getting cold. Repeated this process for the duration of the shower.  Another gripe, there's no security at the elevators. They don't have elevators that serve only hotel guests which gets ridiculous when everyone wants to party at the new hotel and every elevator is packed. There is a card key device where you have to swipe your card before getting access to guest floors...but I never had to swipe my card once. So much for security? People would also hop into the elevators and just ask people to swipe them up to different floors. This is what I blamed for some drunkard pounding on my door several times (along with the doors of our neighbors) at 4 or 5 in the morning.  The service was pretty bleh for a hotel that makes itself look like a giant boutique. They're a newer hotel and I understand that, but surely they should have worked out all the kinks with customer service and their technology systems by now. The rooms themselves were great and fantastic...but the service definitely left me underwhelmed. This is also a party hotel. I'm not sure how many of the people that filled the lobby area or 2nd floor were even staying at the hotel, but it was honestly party all the time. The crowd was pretty young. I would go so far as to say it was closer to the age range of 21-25. However, I'm not a fan of the Jersey Shore-esque, Ed Hardy crowds."
394,train,-1,"Kind of bummed about this place.. Have always been a fan of here. The setting and scenery is absolutely stunning. Pool is great place to lay out, good food and drinks. Unfortunately we went here last time night and had such a bad experience, we went for the pre thanksgiving happy hour, I received an email about it and we have been planning on going for a few weeks now. The bartender was very rude to us, we finally got so frustrated we ended up leaving without ordering anything. I wish our experience wld have been different but I will prob give this place another shot because it's so pretty but will steer clear if the bar area"
3949,train,0,"We enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons in Vegas.  It is off the beaten path and truly feels like an escape from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  The property is a bit dated, but was adequate for our needs.  One area of concern is the pool area.  It's a really great pool, but because of its size, it can feel overrun on a busy weekend day.  We actually decided to abandon the pool on Saturday for this very reason.  On Sunday, however, it was a great place to relax and enjoy the sun.  Like all Four Seasons, the beds are amazing.  If I hadn't spent time visiting the Mandarin Oriental (which was recently built and is in a better location), I'd probably rate this hotel 4 stars.  But, it appears that the owners haven't updated this property in quite some time and the pool area needs to be expanded to accommodate peak crowds.  While I would certainly stay here again, chances are that I'll be staying at the Mandarin during my next visit to Vegas."
8509,train,1,Overall the property was well maintained.  The breakfast items are what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The wifi service did not work well in the room which was a disappointment.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.
6837,train,-1,"I booked the Cosmo by bidding through Priceline, so I didn't pick it specifically. The problem for me with this hotel is that it seems to be aimed at 20-somethings, which I'm definitely not. If you want a hotel that's very slick, modern, and hip, this is probably the hotel for you. If you don't like super-busy, noisy places, or want something more understated (I know, it's Vegas), go elsewhere.   My biggest complaint was with a weird, periodic noise in my room (it almost sounded like a vuvuzela) that made sleeping very difficult, and the service I received to deal with it. The first time I called about it, no one came after about an hour, at which point I left. The second time, in the middle of the night, the engineer couldn't find the source of the problem, but the front desk wouldn't move me. Finally, later that night, when I still couldn't sleep, I called again, and they agreed to move me to a different room (which was quieter but still not very, due to nightclub music).  The fitness center was nice, but I don't know if I'd call it 5-star, and the Wicked Spoon is a decent buffet, but nothing compared to the Mirage's.   I suppose that a lot of people who stay at this hotel don't sleep much there anyway, but if you're not that type, I recommend someplace else."

7200,train,-1,"Came in April just in time to enjoy the weather and balcony of their standard suite with the soaking tub in the window. Check in was interesting the boy told me he liked encore better which annoyed me because I've stayed at Wynn for years and wanted something cooler. The suite was cool and I was very impressed with the decor and balcony.  However...that's when the problems started.  The atmosphere is great don't get me wrong, the bamboo pool was really nice the boulevard pool was just a different quality of people i dunno what was going on over there.  room issues reported. -Bathroom door fell off  -bathtub metal plug broken when arrived had to be replaced -drapes broken wooden shudder wall/seperate  bathroom to bedroom were broken so the steam from bathtub made it into bedroom which was annoying. -minibar fridge is small and has everything packed into it, knocked one item over and was charged literally $100s and had to tell the story over and over to multiple managers and front desk staff to get the charges fixed. If you don't care about an occasional issue then stay here you'll have a good time either way."
1404,train,-1,"I wanted to go to eat the Pho instead of the coffee shop part of this place, but it was noon and none of us have had breakfast so I just go with the flow. When we got it, they seated us far away from the cash register near the Pho side which I thought was strange. Got the menu and started looking at the choices and a lady came up to us to ask for our drinks. We all got water except my husband got an orange juice. She asked if he wanted a small or a large and he told her a small, but she then told him that a large was the size of our water which was probably less than 8oz. I was like what the heck, that's a large!?!? and it's $6!!?!?! What a rip off, but he got it anyway. I got some breakfast item that had meat in it. I don't even remember what it was and my friend got a sandwich. All in all, the food was basic and not good. Price was over the top and the lady who provided the drinks had an attitude. She dropped our water on our table and walked away and when she did take our water order, it was with an attitude. Two big thumbs down."
8588,train,1,"I stayed there for a week (work trip) and it meet my expectations of a HGI. The desk was a nice size, the room was clean and updated, and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable. Shoutout to Mik! He's very professional and helpful."

8906,train,1,Came here to see a jazz and blues show in the Railhead.  The show was great and the drink specials were even better ($5 beer + shot of tequila)!  Had a late dinner at the cafe after and really enjoyed my meal.  Our waitress was a hoot (wish I could remember her name.  She was an older Asian lady) and put up with our strange eating requests (low carb everything).  The liver and onions were awesome.  My date had the NY strip and devoured it.  Being the awesome low carber he is he ordered a 3 cheese omelet to wash his steak down.  They usually have a jazz act once a month so I can see this place being a new hangout.

3389,train,-1,"I have to break this down into two parts.    Location - 5/5.  I couldn't have asked for a better location.  At the edge of town across from a park and a bridge, you have a lovely view of the incline and Heinz Field. However, there is no parking at the hotel and you must either secure street parking (which I lucked out on and was free because I happened to be there over a holiday when the meters weren't in force) or you must pay to park in one of the two garages located across the street from the hotel. There are no in and out privileges, so you must pay every time you exit. This can get pricey.  It is about a 10-15 minute walk to PNC Park and Heinz Field.  You can also walk across the bridge to Station Square.  Hotel itself - 2/5 (which is what I've rated above).  Yes, I know I am staying there over New Year's Eve. Yes, I know I am there for a special event (the Winter Classic). Considering I booked well in advance before they got wind that the Winter Classic was being played in DC, I got the room for a reasonable rate ($159/night, which it jumped up to $259+ after I made reservations).    I lucked out and got a view overlooking the river/stadiums. The doors to the room look a little weird - almost like you're getting ready to fall down into the rabbit hole.  Upon entering the door to the The Shire (as I started calling it, since the door seemed tiny and I felt like I was one of the Hobbits), you walk into the room and your first thought is - where is the rest of the room? Am I in New York City? It is TINY! They cram a lot of stuff into the little room. I liked the dark wood decorations, but the room lacked a refrigerator.  The flat screen was tiny. But the worst part was the bathroom - it did not have a door; rather, it had a frosted glass sliding door that made a lot of noise. When splitting the room with four people, two of whom you don't know all that well, it's not ideal. In fact, you can see through the door almost. Awwwwwwwwwkward! The shower had great water pressure (got a good massage from it), but did not drain so I was standing in Lake Wyndham very shortly after beginning to shower. The hotel is not equipped to handle using two blowdryers at once, so we blew the circuit to half the room. I notified them at 6 PM that the lights were out; we came back from the New Year's Dance Off at 2:30 AM and the lights were still not fixed. The last thing I wanted to do was schlep my drunk ass back down to the desk to get the lights turned on (especially vital since it was the half of the room with the bathroom that was dark, and with the curtains closed it was literally like being in a cave), especially when I had just walked back from Station Square since cabs won't pick up drunk folk on New Year's morning. Someone fixed it within 10 minutes but still....I had told them 8 hours earlier. Not cool.   The bed in my room was uncomfortable - the mattresses were so soft that you rolled into the person you were sleeping with. My sister did not enjoy that I kept rolling into her.  Apparently there is some issue with their cleaning staff since my friends in another room got into their first room and discovered used coffee grounds in the coffee pot and moldy, damp towels in their bathroom.  They were moved to an upgraded room and....got another coffee pot with used coffee grounds in it.  The hotel then comp'd them a breakfast buffet....which consisted of juice and some muffins. They weren't amused.  Had I not been anal retentive about my travel plans, I never would've known that the hotel had been rebranded to a Wyndham from Hilton, which is where I made my initial reservation and I had a difficult time getting confirmation of my new reservation with the Wyndham system.    I would not recommend staying here. It's a big waste of money if you ask me."
9084,train,1,I love the suites... cheap and very nice.  Cafe breakfast ok... pancakes where amazing.  The buffett was delishhhh and cheap. The only issue 2 issues we had... pool is too small but we knew that when we booked. The other issue doors are thin..  we were talking before we started the music to hang out and we already had security in our room because of a noise complaint.  Security said they could hear us down the hallway.. I walked out after they left to double check and sure enough. .. u could hear us... Everything else is what you would expect at a casino.
4094,train,1,I had a great experience her. Server was nothing bad to have around. We were there super late and just had some wings and beers to finish off the night.   It's tucked away in the actuall hooters casino witch is a smaller casino but great place to lay your at at lower prices than some of the bigger hotels.   Take them to go and munch on them in the morning when the hangover kicks in. Helped me!
1895,train,-1,"I made the reservation online at 4 Queens site & then canceled when I found it much cheaper everywhere else & booked at hotels.com. The bathroom was tiny, one person at a time with the door barely clearing the toilet before it hit the tub. No pool. You can use the one across the street at Binions. My wife & I left with negative feelings about the 4Q mostly due to the staff who have apparently never attended a customer relations seminar. Of all the people we dealt with, only the housekeeping staff were pleasant & friendly. Even the waitress at the Magnolia Restaurant (surprisingly good food), while efficient, was cool & aloof. At check in, the couple ahead of us turned away just as the desk clerk said ""Next"" & didn't hear her. She rolled her eyes upward and repeated with an irritated voice, ""NEXT"". My wife looked at me & said ""Oooooo..."". Our clerk was ok, but again, not at all warm or even friendly. The final negative came our last night there. After following 3-4 cars around the full parking garage several times & on our way back to the street, we stumbled upon an open spot on the first level. Since everything below level 3 was valet, we looked on the pavement, on the wall, all over for a sign and saw none. I commented that I thought it was valet only but if it wasn't marked we'd take it. The next morning after checking out, we were loading the car when a valet approached us and said ""Did you park in Valet?"" I replied ""Yes, when ...."" She interrupted and was very upset with us ""You drove past 100 empty spots and park in a spot clearly marked ""Reserved""... I interrupted ""Where?"" She pointed to the ceiling overhang where it was marked ""Valet Parking"" concealed behind a pipe. We honestly looked and didn't see it the previous night but it was dark and we weren't looking up. Point is, even though we had made an honest mistake she was very rude. It appeared to be indicative of the attitude most of the staff had which tells me it's poor management. Even the cocktail waitresses ALL seemed bored & put out to be there. One forced my wife to yield pulling a suitcase. Another staff member made us wait to get off the elevator while he got on. They need a good Customer Service seminar and soon."
2953,train,-1,"Everyone always things ""Oh hooters, great wings"" among other things (hehe). There wings are frickin' AWFUL! Breaded wings, I think you would be better off soaking a bunch of bread crumbs in wing sauce and call it a day. Our waitress acted like she was afraid of us and look I'm sure there are allot of disrespectful brutish men in the world that she has to deal with but my friends are super nice and she barely provided us with a poor excuse for service! Don't go here unless you just want to ogle women...seriously."
8673,train,-1,This place sucks.  Avoid it if possible.  The rooms smell funny. The furniture sucks.  The televisions are from the '90s.

It is close to the Las Vegas Convention Center...but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this sh*t hole.

512,train,1,"The Montelucia Resort & Spa is beautiful.   If you want to kick back, relax, and unwind, Montelucia helps you do that. Park the car (by yourself or valet), check in with the friendly staff, and make your way towards your room. When you make that walk to your room, you'll realize how extensive the property is. But one thing will catch your eye for sure: the Kasbah Pool & Camelback Mountain. Montelucia may sport the best views in all of Phoenix and Scottsdale. If you're staying at Montelucia, you'll likely be in a pool, in a lounge chair, by a fire pit, or at Prado trying to soak in this amazing room.    The property is pristine. Walking the grounds, there is attention to detail and keeping things tidy and clean. There is a Mediterranean feel to the resort. Though busier in comparison to The Royal Palms, there is still enough room to find your own space. You'll be able to find alone time. And if you happen to be by a pool, don't worry, pool staff will make sure you're fed and hydrated.   The rooms are a fantastic escape as well. Spacious. Clean. The bathroom as well. A large separate shower and deep-soaking tub. Lights with dimmer switches. The bed was remarkably comfortable. The living room area had a comfortable couch and a large table in case, somehow, you are bringing work to do. The color scheme in the room brings life to the room, yet someone remains soothing. My room was on the first floor and opened up into a private patio, with with another lounge chair, table, and seats, which opened further onto a grassy area. I'll admit it; once I set foot into the room, it was pretty damn near impossible to leave it.   One can imagine that you may not want to leave the Montelucia. And why would you? Yes, there's the spa. And as for food? There are multiple options. I can't for them all, but I can tell you two things: (1) room service was fantastic and (2) Prado is disappointing. If you go to Prado, go to sit on the patio and enjoy the view. Your first priority there shouldn't be the food.   The Montelucia is an incredible place to get away and rejuvenate. It's paradise and I hope one day I can return."
7495,train,1,The hotel room was amazing. First time staying at the Cosmo & will stay again for sure! Customer service is 100% & they make you feel welcome from the moment you check in. Even if you don't end up staying here (which I recommend u should stay) check out the casino...it's beautiful!
2411,train,-1,"Worst hotel I have ever stayed. Music is loud in the evening, will not stop until midnight. Not a place to rest and relax. Stay away!!!"
4443,train,-1,"Very disappointed in the property.  It got 2 stars only because of the convenient location. First I will start will the parking, the website says 22 dollars to valet but upon arrival that went up to 25.  Only one elevator was in working condition which meant a 5-10 minute wait to get a ride to check in (10th floor).  The room we were given is right across from the ice machine so I listened to ice drop All night LONG!!!!!!! You would think they could at least put it in a room behind a door! We will not consider this property again."
6461,train,1,"Stayed in a suite.  Full kitchen  2 full bathrooms w/jacuzzi Living area Dining area 2 balconies  King bed  1L Fiji water is $9 in the room   Great place to stay. I'm not a gambler and hate cigarette smoke, so walked the 2nd and third floors between east/west towers to avoid he smokey casino.   Sky bride connects to Crystals (high end shopping) across the street and Walgreens.  Fitness center is huge"
2818,train,0,"They have decent rooms here...not good, not bad.    My friend was staying in one of the largest rooms they offer, and it had plenty of space for us to hang out for a while.  There was a mini fridge and small bar area which was nice for drinks, but Hooters definitely feels dated compared to all the other more expensive options in town.  I also ate at the late night cafe restaurant they have here, and it is still one of my only 1 star reviews I've ever written lol.  I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap place to crash, but if you are looking for convenience, scenery, posh decor, or anything besides somewhere to sleep, you may leave disappointed."
4063,test,1,"I stood at this hotel last year on new years day..I needed a cheap roof after spending a gazzilion dollars for a few days at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  I really can't complain, it had clean bed, clean walls, clean floors. I took a nap as soon as I got in (2pm) woke up to the sweet aroma of my favorite food in the world...hooters chicken wings...so what If I was on the 11th floor.   Basically I like to refer this hotel to friends by calling it a glorified Super 8.  The location is great right behind the Tropicana and across the street (and kinda behind) the MGM Grand, legitly a maybe 5 min walk from the strip.  I paid $25 for the night I stood, but honestly wouldn't pay more than $50 since I know how cheap it can be."
1703,train,1,"Choosing a hotel when traveling is always a stressful decision for me. Whichever I choose has to be a delicate balance between location, price, and comfort or frankly, it could ruin whole trip for me.   That being said, I LOVED my stay at the Hotel Alt last week!   Hotel Alt mainly caught my eye because of the affordable price, style (reminiscent of the Aloft chain), and rave reviews -- and I have to say it didn't disappoint!  The Room/Facilities:   At about 120 a night (through booking.com), Hotel Alt is a wonderful value. The rooms and facilities are brand-spanking new, clean, and colorful. The room wasn't huge, but it was very comfortable for two, 20-something girls. The bed was bigger than I expected and the sheets/mattress were soft, giving me some of the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel.   In terms of accommodations, there was an HD TV in the room, along with a phone, iHome alarm clock, iron and ironing board, and Keurig (with a few k-cups).   There is also a small closet (I've seen many reviews saying that there wasn't one -- guess they couldn't find it. lol), drawers beneath the bed, and the staff added a mini fridge upon my request without any trouble or additional charge.  The bathroom was ""spa style"" with a small, wood bench, a shower only (which can be seen from inside the room through frosted glass.. be warned if you're shy haha) as well as surprisingly good shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap for those who forgot their own.   If you're driving up, there is some street parking, but you're probably better off parking in the attached garage. It's quiet and safe and about $23 CAD a day if you don't leave; if you take your car out, it's $28.  The Staff:   Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the area! For every question we asked they had an answer or were willing to look it up for us. They definitely made us feel welcome.  The Location:  Alt is in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Griffintown, which means there's a lot of construction in the area. It's about a 15-minute walk/bike from Old Port/Montreal (which is great on a nice day -- don't get caught in a downpour like we did), but if you're looking to spend a lot of time downtown, it is a bit out of the way... (This is the only reason I knocked off a star).   Aside from that distance, the location of the hotel itself is great. There are several restaurants in the same building including a cute brunch spot, a lively bar, and a Starbucks; it's also about 2 blocks away from New Gas City and a metro, and it was super easy to hail an uber.   Overall, I was happy to call Hotel Alt my maison for a few days and I'd definitely stay again!"
9476,train,-1,"I started out thinking this was a nice hotel; comfy bed, decent pillows, totally great location. Also at the offset, I THOUGHT the staff were really nice and helpful. As soon as we got back home, however, my boyfriend and I realized that they had stolen prescription medications from both of us. When we called to complain that the housekeeping crew had stolen from us, they basically told us to shove it and that there was nothing they could do.   I mean, I realize there probably isn't anything they could do about it, but at least be NICE and pretend you're going to try to help. Being rude and blowing me off just made me really pissed off. Guess not all Mormons are nice."
3335,train,1,"Best stay of our trip from Alaska to Florida. Clean, much of it is newly renovated, comfy beds, free breakfast and friendly & helpful staff. I would return and would definitely recommend it."
6161,train,1,"Stayed here the first month it opened. Definitely one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in.  Extra large extra modern room with a big flat screen TV and another small one in the bathroom.  Central location, fantastic gym, great view from the balcony.  The Cosmopolitan buffet is the #1 buffet in Vegas."
7267,train,1,Dope venue to see a show. Just the drinks are way to expensive. $72 for 4 beers. C'mon that was bullshit. But the concert was great. Very surprise how the set-up was. It was well done. INTERPOL COME BACK SOON!!!!
1514,train,0,"Who doesn't like Fremont Experience, the old stale smoke of lingering in every crevice of the spot.  I came here because I had enough credit for a free room and I was upgraded to one bed room suite. The only thing I had to pay was for parking which was $4 with unlimited in and outs. Our room was very nice, my gf and I usually stay at the strip and we were pleasantly surprised. Our room included a comfy bed, a wet bar and a pull out sofa couch with granite and tiled restroom. Furthermore, this place is right next to Fremont and the recycling park so it's pretty fun to walk around. Best part is they are one of the few hotels with no resort fee!  Overall, the staff here was friendly and we can't really complain because we didn't pay anything for a suite. As long as you keep your expectations in check we didn't care that we weren't at our usual vdara or cosmo. If you're looking to stay at a place on fremont street, I would recommend this place if you're looking to save a couple of bucks."
611,train,-1,"Not satisfied with service! Took a 2-day -almost $200 - family pass with night tour and 'highroller' included. They didn't explain that their night tour service only takes off once at night (7pm - only mentioned on the map), if you miss it you're screwed: yup paid for no reason and of course no refund. Second day finally took the bus and went to the highroller, although with purchased 'tickets' in hand you have to get in line to 'validate' the voucher: 30min wasted. Then, hopping off is easy, hopping back on? One hour wasted (instead of the 30min they tell you). The app needs a serious update as well, no real-time arrival information. Once you make it finally on the bus it's pretty overcrowded so only a happy few have access to the open upper deck. Decided to give a second star after all because staff is very friendly."
7245,train,1,"Stayed here for one of my friend's birthday's last weekend and the Cosmo is the spot to be at ! Check in was easy, parking was easy, rooms were spectacular, marquee nightclub was awesome, and checkout was easy. No problems with the Cosmo ! I was so excited to stay here because I feel that the Cosmo is literally in the middle of everything in Vegas so everything around us was easily accessible or if not taxis were everywhere to pick you up and take you where you need to go. We got 2 suites and had a girls and boys room and they were really nice ! Especially the views of the strip were on point. Very clean rooms and the beds felt like you were sleeping on a cloud for dayz. The bathroom area is huge and perfect for the ladies to get ready for a night out. I loved the elegance to this place. The ambiance was a really nice touch with draping chandeliers everywhere and nice shiny tile and shops in the cosmo for every tourist need. We even went to the Marquee night club that first night and saw Tritonal ! (you can read my review on the Marquee, not gonna go in detail) and Wicked Spoon was conveniently in the hotel as well and is one of the better buffets on the strip which was amazing as well ! The hotel has taxi/limo service out where the valet is and goes by quick too. Overall, my stay here at the Cosmo was amazing ! Definitely the happenin' hotel and I will definitely be coming back !"
3232,train,-1,"They didn't have the room I reserved.  It's didn't have the two beds.  I have three kids, so it was a little rough.  My son had to sleep on the couch and the roll away didn't fit.  The breakfast wasn't bad.  Check out the view from my room."
8304,train,1,"Outstanding ambience, delicious authentic Chinese cuisine& fabulous service! The Cha Garden and pool area are beautiful venues. Looking forward to hosting events there. Great team!"
5672,train,1,"This is my new favorite hotel in Vegas. Really efficient and service-oriented check-in/registration process - they come over to get you in line and also have iPads at the desk so you can browse while you're waiting.   My room was upgraded to one with a balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountain and had a small kitchenette with a fridge/freezer and microwave. The room was huge with a sitting area, two TVs, and a large bathroom and shower. Everything in the room is very modern, perhaps almost too modern given that it was hard to figure out how to turn off all of the lights.   The common areas of the hotel are beautiful, especially the bar with the huge chandelier. For those people who like efficiency, the parking garage with color-coded lights by parking space is a sight to behold."
1109,test,1,I have stayed here a few times and it has always been a wonderful trip! This past time my husband and I came down for a weekend away after he got back from a deployment. They sent up chocolate covered strawberries and champagne on the house to thank him for his service. I was so blown away! This is why I am true to Marriott - they have the best customer service! Thank you & we will be back again soon!!
415,train,1,"This resort is absolutely beautiful with stunning views of Camelback. This resort has the best rooms in the Valley. Most resorts are older and have not been kept up. Montelucia is newer and has all the modern amenities with a fantastic large rock shower in each room. The pools were also private and didn't have a bunch of gawkers. The place where Montelucia fell short was the service. The service, while not bad, is not on the level of a 5 star resort. Service is not up to a five star resort like the Four Seasons."
4075,train,1,The Host was very pleasant and the food was hot and delicious when I'm back in vegas I'll definitely come here again
6653,train,1,"Those fuckers at the Cosmo have the best buffet in town. Won a bunch of money at the Hard Rock Casino, and treated my family to an all you can eat buffet. The only thing that would have made this better, would have been an all you can drink option. They had everything from Mac and Cheese, mini hot dog weiners, to Hibachi (seafood only), grilled chicken, beef, and omg the gelato. I left the buffet feeling as though I had a food child inside of me. It was pricey ($44.00/per person) but it was so worth it.   I didn't really have much other experience with this venue, but after a quick walkthrough I can say that it is a nice place with a cool vibe and would definitely consider staying here in the future."
5479,train,-1,"what to say?...  So we arrive and after waiting for an hour to check in we are told that we are going to be charged an additional $450 for incidentals for our stay, then we were told that it was just a hold, then we were told that since we prepaid over the amount for the rooms at booking there were to be no charges.  He did need my credit card for verification, which he immediately charged the $450 to which I didn't know until checking my account. Then upon arrival to our room we noticed housekeeping pulled a splash and dash, and nothing was really clean.  Our terrace had the remnants of a broken glass and some kind of juice stain all over it.  We called 4 times to have housekeeping come out, and they never did.  Even on the daily housekeeping routines they never checked the terrace and never ran a vacuum.  Throughout our stay we also noticed things like chip crumbles in the hallway for 2 days, a water bottle on the floor in the ice room for our whole stay and numerous other things that fell back on housekeeping.  For a hotel this nice I would hope for some cleanliness! I never heard one story or saw anyone win anything on the casino floor.  The bars where cool, the breakfast at the buffet was good (way better than buffet food!), the restaurants and shops all were great.  Now I am back home and checking my accounts and I see they charged me an extra $200.  Just a one time charge of $200 3 days after my stay.  I would have checked my itemized receipt that I was promised in email at check out but I haven't received it.  I can only assume it is for the broken glass and stain on the terrace that was there when we arrived but who knows...  I have tried to contact them 4 times today and whoever the operator tries to put me through to the phone just rings until it goes to a busy signal and hangs up.  Oh and the stupid tv control thing, yeah its a pretty neat idea to have all of your room controls on your tv, but the thing had to be reset constantly just to function as a tv.  Then when we tried to order a movie one late night and it didn't work the tech noticed that I was never properly logged into the system.  He called the front desk and had them log me off and then back in.  But they all forgot to tell me that after that my keycards wouldn't work anymore.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying here.  The service is slow or non existent, check-in is not only slow but charged me unnecessarily, compared to other casino hotels we have stayed at the cosmo is expensive, a tad rude, dirty, and in general not worth the hype."
4461,train,0,"Hotel is great. However their parking situation is atrocious! Horrible valet service. It's not that the guys working the valet are horrible but they need more help to count for the hotel guests and the people just there to dine at the hotel restaurant Fahrenheit. Yeah they'll make it sound good that it's $22/day and you can leave and come back as many times as you want but good luck retrieving or bringing your car back in a timely matter. Expect to wait 20+ mins to get/park your car. Even Stevie Wonder could see how much of a hot mess their ""Valet Service"" is."
610,train,-1,"One star for the friendly tour guides on the microphone. At the first stop, the bus broke down. We had to wait in the heat for a replacement. I wasn't in my seat yet and the bus driver gunned it, causing myself and the guide to both lose our balance. My knee bled through my jeans after banging it. They don't offer to assist with injuries. We told an employee in a neon yellow shirt about it later and he provided the number to call to report it. He refused to provide his name, stating that this company doesn't allow them to give out their names. I won't file a claim. I just want the drivers to wait until all are seated to avoid injuries. So this star goes to Gloria. She works very hard. I hope they advance her in the company and get her out of the sun. Bad experience but the route looks like it would have been awesome. Ride at your own risk!"
3099,train,0,"I stayed here for 5 nights on a work trip. There were only a couple things I didn't care for and the rest was good.  What was bad:  This hotel is very close to the airport and the sound of airplanes taking off and landing were very prevalent in my room; to the point where it felt like my walls were rattling. There have been other reviewers that have mentioned they couldn't hear the airplanes, but I sure could. I was in a room with one king size bed on the first floor on the west side of the building. I could hear the water fountain outside my window and any time someone slammed a door (which didn't bother me) and every time an airplane went over head which lasted until about 3 in the morning or so when there would be a few hours reprieve (or else I was just so tired I finally slept through it). I didn't sleep well and by the time Friday came I was exhausted.   Not including the noise from the airplanes it's otherwise a very quiet hotel. The other thing I didn't care for was the key pad on the west door entrance didn't work very well. My first night there I put my key in and it flashed green and let me in without a problem. I went back to my car for my second load, had my arms full and put my key in and it flashed red. I swiped it again and it did nothing. I tried it about 5 times before resigning to walking around to the main entrance and stopped by the main desk to have my key looked at. They told me my key was fine (double checked to make sure) and informed me the key pad on that particular door is just finicky and sometimes doesn't work.  The next day it happened again and I had to walk around to the main lobby entrance. I asked 2 different hotel workers if there was a trick to getting the lock to work if it was just hit and miss? They told me it just didn't work sometimes and that door has been known to cause problems.  I later discovered the trick myself, so if you ever stay here and have a room on the west side and want to use that entrance, save yourself some frustration and unlock the door as follows: insert card key into key pad slot and proceed to slide it up and down very quickly repeatedly until it flashes green. It worked every time using this technique and I never had to take the long way around to my room since discovering it.   What was good:  I really liked having central air/heat with an electronic thermostat  The bed was really comfortable and the pillows were better than the ones I sleep with at home  The room was spacious and comfortable  Some people complain about the placement of the TV, but really it's in the best possible spot. It swivels so you can watch either from bed, or the couch.  Staff was friendly and polite  It was clean  They have a 24/7 menu that included 2 gluten free items. I tried both the Spinach Salad and the Chicken Tortilla soup and they were both good. I had brought my own tortilla chips that went really well with the soup.  It was within walking distance of the strip with good walking shoes. Head west for about a mile or so down Harmon and there you are.   Overall I thought it was a nice place, but the airplane noise was really getting to me by the end of my trip and is what would keep me from returning. I haven't stayed anywhere else near there, so maybe that's as good as it gets for airplane noise. I don't know."
7503,train,1,Great service. Very clean! Beautiful suite. Check in/Check out was without any problems.   Close to everything.....and we really enjoyed ice stating at the hotel ;)
3712,test,-1,"So first off, we get seated and had no one come up to us after 15 minutes so I went to get someone. The manager had to take our orders. I wanted to go there to eat and watch the olympics track and field which I missed because they failed to get it on the tv and took way too long. No empathy was shown. Everyone there had attitude. The food was cold cold. And the bathrooms and disgusting. It was awful experience. Will not return and I suggest you go somewhere else. Worst experience in a hotel and casino ever."
3727,test,-1,"My husband and I took a road trip down to Vegas, we chose the hooters casino hotel because it was a really good deal for 5 days. Once we got there, to check in it took awhile and when we asked the staff member a question she didn't have a clue...   Once we got into our room, we have a king bed and the room was fairly large, we loved the size of the room and the size of the bathroom. The down side was the Internet was slow, shower has inconsistent temperatures, stained bathtub, water wouldn't turn off properly.. I think they need to do some Reno on the hotel. On the plus side food there was decently priced!   I would stay there again for the price, but overall I think they need to update their amenities in the hotel rooms.."
7549,train,1,Best hotel in Vegas hands down.  Don't think i need to say much just know it's amazing and worth EVERY PENNY!
483,train,1,"Yes the resort is gorgeous, the rooms beautiful and staff overly friendly.  If i were just rating the resort i would give it 4+ stars but due to the restaurant and spa experiences i am knocking off a star.  We ate at the restaurant for breakfast one morning, i ordered an egg white omelet which took forever.  When it came i almost choked on it b/c there was a 2 inch branch in my omelet. Literally.  I called the waitress over and she said she would check. She came back and said it was a thyme branch, no apologies or anything.  I seriously would have choked had i swallowed it.  The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth - no pun intended :)  the spa: is GORGEOUS. No doubt.  however, i am not sure my massage was worth the cost. I get massages regularly and my masseuse and my husband's masseuse were super chatty.  If i am paying $150 for 50 minutes i want to zone out and relax...not have you telling me stories about your kids and weather.  The facilities are gorgeous, i wish i just got a day pass to lounge in there instead of the massage."
6196,train,1,"I was fortunate to have been invited by friends. I stayed at the wrap around suite on the 54th floor. The view was breathtaking! You can watch the fountain show from the Bellagio and take in the view. It's epic for New Years Eve because you'll have one of the best views in Vegas for the fireworks show.   I ended up sleeping in their pull out couch and I woke up thinking i was in a real bed. I didn't realize it was a pull out couch until i saw the ""bed"" from a distance and realized it was a pull out bed from the couch. The sheets are sleek and feel oh so soft. Pillows feel so soft that you don't want to leave the bed. If you have money to burn or have friends that are high end rollers, stay here! It's one of the best!"
3842,train,1,"The Cosmopolitan is designed in such a way to make you feel as if it is evening whenever you're inside, unless you're next to a window. Mostly everything is painted a slick black, with accents and dimly lit lights. It is *the* hotel and casino to visit at night, especially because of its stellar (mostly affordable) dining and drinking options. It is also the place you will come across the most interesting-looking people, from a fashion standpoint. It is my favorite hotel and casino on the strip. The Cosmo houses many great bars and lounges, such as Bond, Vesper, the Chandelier, and Beauty & Essex.  Bond can be found on the first floor at the front entrance facing the Bellagio, and is completely open, with its only wall consisting completely of Windows. Onlookers can view the strip from here. There is a glass case with the bar name on it, and you might see someone hired to dance in there occasionally.  Vesper, meaning evening, evening prayer, or evening star, embodies all possible definitions. Also found on the first floor, but near the registration desk and video embedded pillars, Vesper bar is another open lounge with comfortable seats.  The Chandelier is probably the most interesting bar and lounge in the Cosmo. The entrance can be found on the second floor, but the lounge is two floors tall. You can walk down a short flight of steps which take you to the second floor, which rests halfway between the first and second floors of the Cosmo. This lounge is difficult to miss, as it is entirely incased in crystals in the shape of a giant chandelier. If you don't go for drinks, at least go to marvel in the design you will only find here.  Beauty & Essex was in my bookmarks to visit, but I didn't get around to it. It can be found on the third floor, and looks unassuming from the entrance. I can only imagine it to be an illusion, because from outside the Cosmo you can see the protrusion of the lounge, with walls made of only windows. I am sure the view is great, and am looking forward to trying it when I return. The Cosmo also houses diverse dining options, such as Secret Pizza, China Poblano, Jaleo, Ã© by Jose Andres, Holsteins Shakes and Buns, Eggslut, Wicked Spoon, and Rose, Rabbit, Lie. There are many restaurants that are affordable, and also many restaurants that are quite expensive because of their high quality.  There is something for everyone at the Cosmopolitan."
4805,train,-1,"This past weekend, spent 4 days in Vegas. The trip was great, outside the hotel. We originally booked the hotel through Hotwire.com over 2 months before the trip, so didn't know which hotel we were committing to, but it showed as 3 star hotel, on the strip, with 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor, so we booked it. Was going on a golf trip with 2 other guys, so Hooters was fine when we found out.   Problem started at checkin. They didn't have our reservation, and said Hotwire didn't fax it. The girl at the front desk said, nothing they could do, ""next time book directly through us"". Seriously? I ask if they can call Hotwire for me - 'can't do that'. I was surprised at the attitude and inhospitality. I asked to speak with the manager - she wasn't available to talk to us. I ask if they can at least get us in a room, I'll give them my credit card number - I have confirmation number, reservation number, everything Hotwire sent me to confirm I went through and paid for this room already.   While at the desk, I called Hotwire, where I was on hold for over 20 minutes. When someone finally came on, they transferred me and refaxed (they said their records showed originally faxed in June). They couldn't stay on the line with me, so waited (all the while, I'm waiting at the registration desk). I waited for another 10 minutes, it never came through, so had to call Hotwire again (again Hooters tells me, nothing they can do, I need to call them, and ask them to fax it again). They said they didn't even have Hotwire's phone number. While on hold, ask to speak to the manager again, this time she was available, this is where things started to really fall apart. She essentially said ""that's what I get for booking through a 3rd party"", I didn't even know how to respond to that. She said nothing they could do. When I finally got Hotwire on again, they again refaxed (I can't believe they're doing all this via fax). This time the Hotwire person stays on the line with me. Another 10 minutes later, Hooters finally gets it.   Just to upset us more (it seemed), the counter person checks in the next group in line instead of us.  All in all, I get into the hotel room over 2 hours after we got to the Hooters. No apologies, just a bad attitude. I would have been fine if they were polite about the whole matter, I understand things go wrong with technology. But to blame me for making reservations not directly through them, to be rude (not just from staff, but from the manager), unbelievable.   BTW, hotel is in terribly old, run down condition (this is in the old San Remo), the dealers were rude, and the elevators smelled."
8690,train,-1,"I drove in from Vegas for a conference, checked in to the room and it's ancient. The fan/AC settings are hot, off, and cold. No temperature adjustments, the elevator was out of order, both remotes had dead batteries, the room phone handset didn't work, and lastly, my first night there, I found blood stains on one of the pillows. A very disappointing stay all in all. The upsides? Good breakfast."
7471,train,-1,The absolute WORST service we have ever had on the strip.  The bell desk LOST our bag and 4 weeks later they call and tell me they found it and they would ship it out. 2 weeks after that phone call i called them to say hey where the hell did you ship my bag...they say we never shipped it we are waiting on a method of payment from you.  Short story I am yet to get my bag even offered to pay.  Not one manager has called me back i have left over 20 voice mails or messages to talk to someone. I dont know how an upscale hotel functions like this...cosmo you're pathetic.
8804,train,1,"I have been on the road for a little over a week and I am coming to find out that Best Western has been consistently satisfying.  I am traveling on a budget and, at $80-$100, Best Western is a little more expensive than a seedy motel,  which seem to run $50-$70. The extra money is well worth it.  This particular location was exceptional because of the sliding glass door leading out to a grassy area which also led to their heated pool.  Also,  there was plenty of convenient parking for my car and moving truck with a 2nd car on a tow dolly.  The continental breakfast is a great money saver and motivator to start the day early with do-it-yourself waffle making (at every location so far), sausage,  scrambled eggs,  coffee,  etc.  Also exceptional,  this location includes an exercise facility and outdoor dining area (chairs and tables with umbrellas)  overlooking the pool area. The room,  as always, was well furnished with free wifi and cable.  I highly recommend this location.  P.S.: There are also plenty of restaurants and different amenities nearby."
1426,train,0,"We prefer to stay in condo-style hotels and got an excellent government rate at the end of May. I found the reviews on TripAdvisor to be more helpful than those on Yelp. All the public spaces are modern and new but, as expected, our room needed some fixtures replaced. For example, the bathroom sink, tile, and cupboards where visibly worn.   Check-in and the reception desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Our deluxe king room was impeccably cleaned and had all the kitchen supplies that we needed. There was one mistake for the minibar but the hotel corrected in after we called. If the price, amenities, and location across from the Eaton Center are what your looking for I would recommend this hotel."
9576,train,1,"To sum up my experience --- big lobby, clean/spacious room, large and comfortable bed, big flat screen TV in the room with plenty of cable channels and large parking lot. All it was missing was a continental breakfast and I would've been in hotel heaven."
5526,train,0,"I came here to play over the Summer of 2015 and my friend and I had a blast! The dealers and pit boss were really nice. We decided to gamble here because they offer $5 Black Jack and $5 Craps. We played for hours. Came in at night and left after breakfast. Even though the dealers and pit boss were fun and nice, the Hooters girls were not so nice, but oh well.  I am giving it 3 stars because it looks tacky- I would never stay here, but I sure would play here!"
8818,train,1,"Great price, free wifi, fridge, microwave, and clean rooms with cable. No complaints here!"
6644,train,0,"Very swank. Lots of bars and restaurants to chose from. Have stayed here twice and the views can range from ok to amazing. Modern larger rooms with stunning bathrooms. Only a couple of downsides: smoking everywhere, including at bars. And no lap pool, which seems crazy for a hotel of this caliber and size. And the one pool open in the ""off"" season closes at 5p and doesn't open until 9a. That's easily fixable since there are plenty of pools on the property that sit empty most of the time..."
5390,train,-1,Worst experience ever in Las Vegas!! Room was disgusting and wasn't going to complain until I tried to take a shower this morning and you either get a super hot shower or super cold. No in between. Plus the drain doesn't work so you not only get a burning hot shower or cold one but you get to sit in the vegas scum your are trying to shower off from the night before. Then when you ask for help two hours later they send up a service guy that can't help you until another two hours. When I spoke to the front desk they said they will switch our room. I informed them I wanted to go eat breakfast before we switched rooms. They promised to hold a room. Once I get to the front desk they have no idea what I'm talking about and Marco front desk tells me there will be a wait for my next room. I informed him I was told a room was already being held for me. At this point I start to get frustrated and ask what happen to the room that was promised. He pretty much told me he can refund my money and I can find another hotel. I reminded him that all hotels are booked and its march madness right now. He said again he can refund me to go somewhere else. At this point I ask for a manager. Imelda comes over and again reminds me she can refund my money to go somewhere else. Nothing they promised me was followed through and now I'm pissed. I finally give up and ask for names and let them know I will be filing a complaint. Then I give my phone number to them to call me once they pull their heads out of their asses. As I am walking to the elevator Imelda calls me and said she has a room ready that's a suite with one bed and a pull. For you to get any service or help you have to go through a miserable five our ordeal and ruin half your time on vacation to get any help. Worst service in my life will never recommend this hotel or restaurant to anyone. Hate this place in hell.
942,test,1,"I'm not good at writing long reviews, so to the point... Great castle. Had our wedding here in July 2015. Rooms were nice, staff were nice, grounds are beautiful, owl and hawk were amazing. Probably one the best parts was our piper Andrew. Super friendly and a wealth of knowledge. And a darn fine piper to boot. The wedding wouldn't have been the same without his participation."

Great rates had friends at the ariea and we had the better hotel!! favorite on the strip"
5644,train,1,"Glitz and glam....  I love this place because of the crystal and pink chandeliers, the big stilettos you can take pictures with, the cool amenities in the rooms (changing the temperature and lights from the touch of your tv remote, holla!), the swanky lounges, this lounge area with a public pool table, lovely decor and art, variety of eats (check out holsteins and the secret pizza place behind STK) and the super comfy beds.  Great hotel to stay in for my birthday, thanks mi amore! xo  The rooms are pricey during the weekend, though I don't know the exact number.  We stayed there sunday till tuesday and it was still over 200 bucks a night.  I hated the pool area (not the one in Marquee) because it was small  and cramped with not a lot of free seats.  The loungers around the pool were by reservation only, so not sure what the process is for that.  It's not even a real pool, one of those wading ones that go up to your ankles so basically it's bodies sitting in each other's water.  It was disappointing  to go there and have to turn back around because there were no seats.  But overall, this has to be one of the nicest hotels of the strip.  I would've given them a 5 if the pool area didn't annoy me as much..."
6009,train,1,"I love the rooms, the location, even the gambling!  And I lost money!  It's a good thing that my friends get comps here cuz I wouldn't have been able to see a room otherwise.  They had a great view of the strip and almost a full kitchen!  Complete with dishwasher!  Who washes dishes in Vegas?!  I guess you have the option if you want, but I thought it was hilarious!  I would definitely consider staying here next time.  Hopefully I did enough gambling or lost enough money to get some comps!  Haha!"
9020,train,1,"Stayed here a few times, and the hotel is one of the best stays in the Church & Wellesley (Village) location of Toronto. Comfortable beds and clean rooms, the location is across the street from Alan Gardens and walking distance to the College subway Station on the Yonge-Finch line of the TTC.  Lobby could use some renovation, while elevators are improving in their speed (my first stay, elevators took forever to come down to lobby). A Tim Horton's store at the lobby also gives points to this hotel."
8837,train,0,"Im Ebay ersteigern wir ein Luxus-Wochenende in diesem Hotel und checken am 1. August erwartungsfroh ein. Der Empfang ist freundlich und speditiv. 19 Euro pro Tag fÃ¼r das parkieren in der Tiefgarage dÃ¼nkt uns allerdings mehr als heftig.  Der erste DÃ¤mpfer kommt sofort - die Poolanlage, inkl. Sauna und Dampfbad steht wegen Revision nicht zur VerfÃ¼gung. Ein Grund, warum wir uns fÃ¼r dieses Hotel entschieden haben. Der zweite DÃ¤mpfer liegt im Zimmer, gleich beim Fenster - die dreckige Socke des vorherigen Gastes.  Positiv erwÃ¤hnen mÃ¶chten wir: Die Lage; das Hotel liegt nahe der Autobahn, Stuttgart ist in knapp 15 Minuten erreichbar.  Das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cksbuffet ist toll und sehr fein. Ich bekomme sogar jeden Morgen frischen Porridge :-) Das Zimmer verfÃ¼gt Ã¼ber eine Kaffeemaschine - herrlich!

5586,train,1,"Not to shabby for the price. If you decide to go anywhere south of the strip (Wynn, Encore, etc). I highly recommend you tell your taxi driver to take Koval (back way and easy access from Hooters). Don't be fooled by the taxi driver taking the strip or freeway!"
2000,train,1,"Absolutely incredible Hampton. Stayed here for a wedding at Ashley Manor which is nearby. Nicest Hampton I have ever stayed at.  (And I have stayed at a lot) Service was outstanding! They knew who I was as I walked in. Ok, so how do they do that? Eric at the Desk and Gloria at Breakfast are like long lost relatives. The bed was to die for. I  really wanted to take that white down comforter home with me.( Only kidding Hampton-lol) but really where can I get one for my house?  The bed was super comfy and the room is nice. Here is how I know this is a top notch place. The electricity went out while I was there because of construction on Price/101. No one seemed upset, the guests were not screaming or angry, and everyone handled it smoothly and calmly. That tells me this is a fine establishment with a reputation for good customer service. Sure enough, the lights came back on and everything was great.Gloria went around to all the tables  checking on everyone and reassuring them during and even after delivering the food that was in the toaster, waffle iron, etc. Way to go Gloria! They have a free shuttle so that's a nice added bonus for wedding guests at the Ashley Manor or super shoppers at Chandler Mall. I want to go back and have a staycation immediately. Oh BTW, the Homewood Suites in the same parking lot is gorgeous too if you need a suite hotel. Happy vacationing."
6503,train,-1,"So disappointed in our stay here at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. The first room they put us in was next to a housekeeping storage room so you can only imagine how loud that is. The second room they put us in had leftover cigarette buds!! Disgusting!! I called front desk to let them know about it & all they could say was ""I'm sorry"" so unprofessional!"
8735,train,-1,"I recently stayed for 3 nights at Chaparrel - Soon to be Embassy- suites. Overall it was a negative experience. I made my reservation through Hotwire. There was no mentioning of ongoing extensive reconstruction either in Hotwire or the hotel website. Front desk was clearly a temporary place. The ladies at front desk could not find my reservation and after about 15 min they found a piece of paper with my info on it. Room was fine, so was the swimming pool. No lobby however existed (under reconstruction). During the day there was significant noise from ongoing reconstruction. Free internet was a joke, I couldn't find the wifi in the bedroom and even next to the pool the Internet was super slow. Complementary breakfast (and evening refreshments) were also served in a temporary tent. Quality of food was fine but the appearance resembled a war camp feeding refugees, besides service was very bad. Tables were left messy and every day it took several minutes for someone to come snd wipe em. Also one night we had to park at the furthest slot from our room after a long search. On the other hand, staff were helpful and friendly although one day they woke us from An afternoon nap to make sure we don't want room service (the tag was obviously hanged at door knob). If this was a low to medium scale motel, I would probably rank it 3-4 stars but for a soon-to-be Embassy Suites, even 2 stars is generous. Will I go back? Never. Will I choose another Embassy suites? I will think twice."
3287,test,-1,"So, I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. First the positive. The location is great, rooms are spacious and the staff (every department) is, frankly, one of the most helpful and friendly I have encountered is some time. Room service food was actually good and the Casino is on the smaller side but again, very nice.   So why only 2 stars? The cleanliness of our room was disgusting. Absolutely 100% the nastiest, dirtiest room I can remember. I was frankly shocked. Even when I spoke to Andrew, the Resort Manager, who offered to move me to a larger room, we turned him down. I asked him to just make sure our room was cleaned thoroughly and we would be fine. Upon our return, it was still a petri dish of filth. I personally ended up cleaning some of it myself. The list is just too long to list. We were there for 4 days and half of the items I gave to Andrew were never taken care of , including simple maintenance items. I shudder to think what it would look like if a black light was turned on and what it would find. I believe there is a SERIOUS health issue here and I hope the management takes it upon themselves to do a full assessment of their housekeeping department.   So, it would have been an easy 5 star review if we simply had a clean room. Unfortunately, this never took place. I cannot recommend this hotel unless management addresses the complete failure and disregard for hotel cleanliness.  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d1829539-r323489781-The_Cosmopolitan_of_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#"
454,train,1,"Lucky me! I stayed here between Christmas and New Year's and this resort hotel perfectly fit the bill for a getaway from a brutal Chicago winter. I will note that there is a $25 resort fee and that does not include use of the steam room. Am surprised that the steam room was left out, given the fact that this experience was otherwise inclusive (e.g. use of 24-hour fitness facility, complimentary yoga classes, guided tours up Camelback mountain). The rooms were well- appointed, which is to be expected, and I could have happily conducted all of my activities from the bed. Things could have been better lit around the facility, as the rooms and grounds were dark at times, but this can be easily remedied, and perhaps some of this can be chalked up to the time of year that I visited. The restaurant Prado and Mbar on site are well worth a visit if you are staying at the property."
5800,test,1,"A-MA-ZING.  This is my favorite place to eat, drink, and sleep!  I stayed here when they first opened and got a pretty awesome deal on our suite.  The hotel service here is amazing, but it does get very crowded... that's because it's such an awesome hotel.  Check out the restaurants and bars, they're great!"
5519,train,-1,They have bed bugs like the size of a chupacabra and I got bit in my butt by a bug and don't even get me started on the customer service.
7684,train,1,"The hotel is very busy with things to see and do but the suite isn't very spacious. Love the balcony feature and that it's very clean inside but I wish the sure was a little larger. IMO, this is a great hotel for girls as the decor is more catered for them."
3037,train,1,"The casino itself is pretty old. Its decor needs some update but its not an awful hotel. Its reasonable and nice.  We're staying on floor 9 and have two rooms. Each faces different sides of the hotel. No great views on this floor, sadly. Although on Fremonts side it is loud threw out the night. The other side is very quiet.  Pros: Cheap rooms Rooms with 2 beds come with a fridge They have a pool You get a coupon book-let when you check in 24 hr. Subway restaurant inside casino Beds are comfy 2 restaurants in hotel    Cons:  Floor 9 no great views Ice machine was broken on our floor No buffets in casino   Overall, this hotel wasn't so bad. For the price i would come back."
656,train,1,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  I'm always looking forward to the heated bathroom tiles and the overall design of the rooms have a cool ""at home"" feel that's somewhat lavish, providing for every need.  The location is great, across the street from Wayne Gretzky's restaurant, and it's walking distance to the shopping and sight seeing areas... I even walked to the Hockey Hall of Fame to check that hidden gem out."
8984,train,-1,"Yet another time where I shouls have paid attention to the rating and reviews.   The customer service people are rude, on the phone & in person.   Our room had HALF a roll of toilet paper. No extras hidden anywhere.  The trash wasn't thrown out from the previous tenants. Our bedding had stains on white sheets. The room phone wasn't connected & once I did connect it I noticed there were 0 buttons to dial the front desk or anyone from the hotel.   I called the front desk for pool towels and the lady told me I had to come get them myself because she had a line of people in front of her. When I got there, she was checking a couple in and had 2 other people waiting. 1 lady simply need help with Wi-Fi the guy needed a new room key.   The grounds are decent, room size better than expected. Service horrible. If ur looking for somewhere to sleep and don't care about service then 5 stars here .. Other than that, pay a bit more and be happy somewhere else. Like the Clarendon in Phoenix that place was AMAZING."
3905,train,-1,"This hotel can have a seat at the bottom of the list right next to the Sheraton ATL. The name is misleading because there is nothing grand about it at ALL! This was my first time staying at a Wyndham property and you can bet your last dollar it will be my last!   Upon arrival I was greeted by some construction which caused the taxis to have trouble getting to the entrance. I actually got out before the entrance and was certain I might get run over before I even settled in to this ""grand"" hotel. I walk in to check in and my first clue to run should have been the quaint and cozy aka not grand lobby. However check in was quick so 1 star for you Wyndham.   My stay:   I was in room 1916 near an elevator which is never a good choice to begin with.  The elevators are slow  and some were not in use SMALL room but nice view of river and ballpark Bathroom shower not the best but love the sink Thin walls. I heard the neighbor sneeze wth Free shuttle within three mile radius which was great since I was working at a unique venue within said radius and just far enough outside of my walking zone Guest service never answers the phone  I am trying to think of something nice to say about this hotel but I just can't seem to come up with anything."
6872,train,1,"Great two day mid week stay. Room was modern and lovely, I asked for a view of the fountains on a high floor. Casino was great the bars were fab, great music and sexy dealer at the front by the bar. The pools were great and thank goodness the water was cool as the air was 107 in June! Loved everything about the hotel stay, bag check was very friendly and helpful."

Upside: gorgeous everything, rooms are spacious and clean, casino is awesome to play at..Downside: hella far from all the action in the middle of the strip, but there is a trolley that takes you to Excalibur...mehh sucks when you're hella faded at 4 in the morning and wanting to get back. Overall, great spot to stay if you can afford it."
1742,train,1,"Beautiful resort. Nicely decorated. There are a few grills outside, a pool, a couple of Jacuzzis. Very accommodating.  This place is not too far from the strip.  We were able to get to hotel Cosmo in 15 minutes... but then we took the back road.    My sister and I shared the murphy bed which was surprisingly comfortable.  The staff was great here as well.  I would totally recommend this time share!"
7907,train,1,"Although I've gambled at the Cosmo in the past, last week, my lady and I stayed there for the first time. In the past I've stayed at the Venetian or the Aria.   We checked in late night due to a delayed flight. The receptionist went above and beyond to welcome us. I cannot say enough good things about her other than I wish I could remember her name to give her the credit she deserves. She helped us get checked into a Terrace Suite. We didn't know how lucky we were to get checked into such an amazing room. Walking into this room immediately transported us to the Vegas High Life. View of the Strip and Belaggio Fountains were unforgettable.   We dined at Scarpetta, had cocktails at Beauty and Essex and ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi twice during our stay. Oh, cannot forget the Chandelier Bar.   Our experience at the Comso has made a very convincing case as to why this should be our go to place when in Vegas.   Thank you Cosmo for providing such a memorable experience."

Lazy front desk staff, the rudest manager I've ever encountered in ANY place of business (not just hotels) and strange unknown odors always lingering in the hallways are just some of the problems I had with this place on a recent visit to Toronto. I'm only giving this place one star because the rating scale doesn't let you give zero."
6771,train,1,"Absolutely a gorgeous hotel.  This hotel is definitely designed for a younger, more hip crowd. It's darker and dim inside (by design, not because it's old), and there are lots of chandeliers and crystals along the ceiling and walls.  Although I didn't stay here, I am definitely looking forward to coming back to either stay or have the opportunity to spend more time here to check out the rest of the resort.  We were too busy making our way up to Marquee to really sightsee =P"

I got a really amazing deal through a third party vendor, and we absolutely loved our stay at Pantages from the hotel room to the staff and amenities. The room is modern and updated, with flat screen tv.  Location is prime as it is literally foot steps away from Eaton Center and Dundas Square. Lots of restaurants, shopping, cafe's within close proximity.   When and If we have the chance I would book this hotel in a heartbeat!"
9368,train,0,Now the Fairfield Inn and Suites. Totally redesigned and very nice. Didn't hear anything from the rooms connected to mine. A problem this place used to have.

1362,train,-1,"12.15pm Visited the Coffee Shop based at Treasure Island for a light lunch.  Service    Server very and friendly however on seeing my almost full plate of the left over food she did not question as to why or ask if I wanted something else. My thoughts were perhaps  she was used to people leaving full plates of food which is very worrying and disgraceful for a coffee place/restaurant in a hotel.  Food  Ordered the Qusedillas which came with Pico De Gio and Sour Cream.  I asked for no sour cream. When It arrived it was poorly plated, soggy and tasteless. It was not at all crispy or fresh tasting. The chicken was hard to find and what was in it was stringy and there was lots of onions and what i thought might be stringy green pepper stuck on the cheese. Quite frankly the worse ever one I have tasted anywhere and considering i was starving this tells you a lot."
714,train,1,"What a beautiful place. We stayed with our points for 2 nights with a camelback mountain view.  Only cost 56 dollars in resort fees and taxes.  The room was amazing.  The view breath taking. It's a huge resort.   The pool is open till midnight, we took advantage of that."
2423,train,0,"I stayed at the Wyndham for five days. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: We didn't know that we were in town when the arts festival and Pride were happening but Wyndham was perfectly located for both events! Our room faced the Point State Park, so we had amazing views of the park, river, and bridges. The room is small BUT had everything you need (no fridge though). The beds and pillows are extremely comfortable and I had the best night's sleep. The showers have phenomenal water pressure (maybe too strong for some folks). Despite other reviews, our towels, shampoo, soap, and water bottles were all re-supplied everyday. KUDOS to Debby from Dining Services who was the kindest employee at the hotel! Lastly, the gym was great, it had everything you would need to have a good workout. I appreciate that the treadmills had TVs.   Cons: Valet parking was speedy and efficient. However, the valets did not help nor offer to help with our heavy luggage. Also, $30 a night! At check-in, I met with a Renee Pancakes (seriously) who was minimally enthused, and not very friendly. I'll hash it to a long night shift. With regards to the room, the walls are thin; we heard people being intimate multiple times, and even an alarming scream which brought the attention of hotel security. The WiFi was awful but had its moments. Lastly, we had lunch at the Three Rivers Lounge. While the food was fine, the service was slow (we waited almost 20-25 minutes with only three other tables being served). Our waitress, Lana was VERY kind and friendly.  Overall, we all agreed that we enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham specifically because of its convenient location. I do believe it's overpriced but you are certainly paying for the location, and you can always save a ton of money using Hotwire."
4838,train,0,"The damn resturant is a very good place to eat cheap . The hooter girls are better than the ones we have here.  This place is'nt the first place i would go to gamble that is mgm.

Its vegas part of it is that you get to enjoy all types of people. Your proably just mad because those rednecks would'nt give you the time of day.  Hooters looks for rednecks and sports fans, not ho's who spend more money on makeup than blackjack."
4184,test,1,Hooter's has always been my favorite restaurant in my hometown Houston and my favorite Casino & Hotel in Las Vegas. I love the wings and hospitality. The casino hosts are all great. I like the fact that there is a William Hill Sports Book which is also my favorite sports book in the state of Nevada. I like the rooms that not only nice but very nice rates that is a real deal for Vegas. I have better luck on their slot machines including my favorite Cleopatra Keno. Earning comps for the food is also easier here. Definitely book a stay or package that has food credit and hotel stay.
5783,train,1,"This casino quickly became one of our favorite casinos...clean, high-tech, friendly service.  The parking structure is underground, we appreciated the sensors which allowed us to just glance down each aisle to see if any green lights were visible to indicate a free spot.  They also had security guards on bicycles patrolling for safety.  The casino is new with good ventilation to filter out the different smells.  They gave any new members free slot play which allowed us to win some cash...the staff are friendly and helpful.  One can earn points for anything while spending time there.  There are some restaurants that looked appealing so we will definitely be back to try a few during our next trip.  My brother and his gf will probably get to check out the Marquee club at some point.  With the service being so nice and the casino so clean, we would not have a problem staying at their hotel as well."
3347,train,1,"I'm not sure why this hotel doesn't have more stars because we really enjoyed our stay here. We visited in late February and I used Priceline to book the room, we used the name your own price tool and ended up getting a pretty sweet deal. We ended up with a room on the 24th floor, which is the top floor and we had a view of the stadium and the river, we could also see the incline which was cool. The room we stayed in was  clean and functional. Additionally, all of the staff members that we encountered were pleasant and helpful.   Our room was comfortable, my only complaint is that we were given two beds and we wanted one king, but it was fine. Also, the coffee wasn't the best, but it did the job. On our last day we ordered room service for breakfast and the food was good. I ordered an egg white and veggie scramble with toast and a pot of coffee; the veggies were fresh and the coffee was strong and delicious.   We enjoyed the location of the hotel as well because we were able to get to and from other neighborhoods very easily, but then again we don't mind long walks."

I literally jumped in the car & drove from California. We booked the closest hotel to the hospital. What an amazing hotel & staff! Super nice staff. Very clean and the complimentary breakfast was delicious! When the General Manager, John Villarreal found out why we were there, he left a lovely condolence card and a platter of cheese & crackers. They even adjusted our rate to a hospital rate to help our costs. I would suggest this hotel to anyone & everyone. We stayed here 3 nights (till my daughter was discharged) and we're sad when we had to leave. We had to move to a new hotel closer to their home.  I am so grateful to John and his staff for making our stay, in the worst of circumstances, so very nice!"
1243,train,-1,"Just had a terrible experience here. My wife and I stopped by on our way out of town for souvenirs due to a suggestion from a local. While it seems very dated there is construction which seems like an attempt to make it better. As we walked through the casino to the gift shop all of the signs said it opened at 7:30. We were walking through at 7:15. We thought no problem, being that we could gamble at any machine since we were the only customers on the gambling floor. Everything was fine until we were carded. My wife and I are in our late twenties and have not been carded in a number of years. My wife had left her wallet in the car since we didn't realize the gift shop wouldn't be open when we arrived. The employee said my wife couldn't continue. While annoying and not up to the level of customer service that is to be expected from a casino we understood that it was within her rights to ask. After getting her ID and losing the rest of the money into the machines my wife and I proceeded to the gift shop at 7:35. After hanging around for a few minutes with no one appearing to open the shop, we started heading towards the front in an attempt to get more information. On the way, the same employee that carded us walked by and we inquired as to the gift shop to only be informed that it wasn't open till 8 and that all of the signs were wrong. We complained at registration as to our concerns for what had happened. Aside from a scripted sorry and a promise that it would be open soon the clerk wasn't anymore helpful or concerned with keeping willing customers happy. This was our first and last time stopping at this place. It is definitely not a place that wants to cater much less be decent to people willing to spend money in their establishment. The basic rules of hospitality were nonexistent to say the least. Save your money for somewhere that is worth it."

The room we were upgraded to was fantastic....very large ""living"" area with a wet bar and mini-fridge (careful, it's an electronic mini-fridge that is stocked, so if you tip something over from its space, you will be charged!), a nice sized bedroom area, and a really cool bathroom.  The living area included a large closet with a safe, and additional amenities, such as robes and slippers.  The bathroom had a huge walk in shower, and the BEST Japanese soaking tub that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip.    And the best part was the very nice balcony, also overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the strip....very cool space.  Upon arrival, we had prompt and courteous check-in from the front desk, and we were assigned to the tower with elevators directly behind check-in.  As a Platinum Marriott member (this is an Autograph Collection property), while there was not a traditional concierge lounge, there was a small lounge with coffee and newspapers right off the lobby to which we had access.  The first night was awesome.  We had a great night's sleep.  The next night, apparently a group of young people checked in next to us.  At around 9:30, there was an outright party on the balcony next door....music blaring, dancing, singing, cigarettes and perhaps other smokables, and shots, beer and booze was flowing.  Since it was only 9:30 in the evening, even though they were annoying, it IS Vegas, and it was evening time, so no big deal.  We thought ourselves lucky when, later that night, it seemed they closed down the party and went out.  Unfortunately, at about 3:30 a.m., they apparently had left the bars, and were back in force....the music was louder, the booze smoke was thicker and they were apparently trying to ""one up"" one another in drinking.  We let it go for about an hour, then called downstairs.  Security apparently came up, because it quieted down.....for about 30 minutes....then it was back!!  After about another hour of trying to endure, we got dressed and walked downstairs to talk to the front desk.    The young lady we talked to handled the situation with outstanding professionalism.  She got security upstairs right away, apologized, and offered us a f&b credit.  Although the music had stopped when we went back upstairs, I have to credit the stamina of those young people....they continued to sit outside and smoke and drink until 10:00 a.m.  In any case, the next day, we got a very nice call from a manager.  He again apologized for what had happened that night.  He assured us that they do not tolerate that kind of behavior and that the room had been warned that they would have to leave if any additional complaints were made.  We heard nothing else from our neighbors, and we were very pleased with how the hotel handled the situation!  During our stay we ate several meals on property, at locations including the Egg Slut, Secret Pizza, Wicked Spoon (twice!) the diner and the best - STK.  All of the meals were good to outstanding.  I will have separate reviews on those.  The casino was well organized, well staffed and very clean.  We spent a good deal of time in the Sports book bar, and enjoyed it.   The location of the hotel is outstanding too....  We did not use the pools or the fitness center, but if they're as well managed as everything else, I'm sure they're great."

909,train,-1,"February-2013 - Just to respond to Jeff S's comments and claims: (1) At no time were we told that the internet was out and would stay out just because the other innkeeper was not there to fix it.  We WERE told, repeatedly, that the connection in our assigned room always worked, and that we were free to try other rooms.  It didn't work at all, anywhere in the Inn, the 2nd night.  (2) We were never offered assistance in finding another hotel in the area.  When we left the Inn, we had to go to McDonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced. (3) The second night, we were the ONLY guests in the Inn, so there was no one else there to be ""understanding.""  We were only informed about the death in Karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being ""privileged"" and from California.   (4) We were charged $111.66 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the Inn.  To date, we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded.  It is certainly NOT TRUE that we received a refund for the nights we stayed, although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services.  We are sorry that the innkeepers see this as ""an inconvenience.""  We see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation."
7939,train,-1,"The bar Chandelier at Cosmopolitan is TERRIBLE. One of our friends, who was over 21, did not plan to drink, and so did not bring her ID to the bar. But the female server asked for an ID - which is of course fine. That's the law. She's required to do that.  The problem was her attitude. That bitchy attitude of playing down the customers to feel better about herself. She basically KICKED OUT the whole group because of ONE person, who did not even order drinks.  The funny thing is that she did not even ask for IDs to other people. Which is why I think my argument that her attitude is so disconcerting is totally valid.  If she had asked us to leave in a more polite way, it would have been fine. She did not even come to take orders for more than 15 minutes.  Besides, the signs in the whole hotel don't even indicate where the restrooms are. This is something really basic and I wonder how this hotel got early raves.  This is a pretty new hotel and I would first get the staff educated before spending all the revenue on countless chandeliers. The fact that they don't even have a number for customer service on their website just shows how careless they are about their staff education and the feedback of their customers.  There are much better hotels all throughout Las Vegas, for the same money. Some of them are even nice to customers who aren't even staying at their hotel.   So please be wise and spend precious money and time somewhere else. You deserve it."
282,train,0,"A very conveniently centrally positioned location for meeting up with friends: however in the restaurant on the first floor, with, it has to be said, a magnificent outlook over Princes Street, the service is very slow; so better suited for a leisurely get together than an express drop in."

8466,train,-1,"Look, I know what (not) to expect from what is actually a Motel 6. The rooms themselves are so-so for the price range, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I booked my stay online, and it was a WASTE OF TIME. The first receptionist (albeit a sweetheart) was absolutely clueless that such a process even existed. Ignoring the small deposit, with the summary of the remaining balance listed in the online confirmation I had her read, she had no record of any reservation made. Despite being charged a small portion of the night's charges already, my remaining balance was ignored, and I was charged the full amount.  ""You don't need to make reservations; we're pretty much NEVER full"", she said. This is important.  My room was a bit lacking in basic bathroom supplies, so when I returned to the lobby late that night I was blown off by the second receptionist. ""We don't keep any of that here"", she said sternly, moving on to the next task*. EVERY hotel and motel I have ever been to (read my reviews, I go to a lot) keeps items in or near the lobby. This is unacceptable, even for this chain.  Oh, and by ""next task"", I mean telling two gentlemen there were no rooms available whatsoever, despite the fact there were still openings online and the previous staff member acknowledged the facility was no where near capacity.   So basically, there is complete ignorance of the online booking function, an absolute disregard for basic hospitality, and at worst, the unethical practice of straight up lying to potential customers to deny service. Never coming back."
6337,train,-1,"This review is geared towards those groups that are planning events at The Cosmopolitan. I've had a harrowing and mind-numbing experience with the Sales staff there, especially the sales person responsible for our account, Nicole Schmitz. After weeks of discussion and finalizing all the details, we received a contract for rooms and meeting space from the Cosmopolitan (roughly $400,000 worth of business for them), which clearly stated on Page 1 that everything was on hold for our group for TWO WEEKS during which time we were to review the 15 page contract and get back with any edits.   After ONE WEEK, we sent back our comments which were minor - mostly small stuff that had been agreed to, over email discussions, but had not made it in to the contract. We were notified the following day that the Cosmopolitan could no longer honor the contract as they had given away the space to another group. We were shocked as wed spent weeks working together and finalizing details. The sales person was unapologetic and completely not bothered. I requested that she get her director and VP on the phone and that we jointly work out a solution. She said that they were in meetings and then made excuses that they'd left work early.  Worrying about what would happen to our company's event that was being planned for those dates, I emailed the CEO of the Cosmopolitan. No response from him either, for a few days, till their SVP of sales got in touch with us, after repeated follow ups from our side, and with absolutely no apology and a serious lack of concern or customer service basics, said that they'd do the contract as they sent it to us, without any of the terms and conditions that had been agreed to over email.   At this point they'd already put me through 3 days of hell, while I had to reach out to every property on the strip and find availability for our group over the dates we wanted.  Thankfully in the 3 days that Cosmopolitan ignored us, we were able to get another venue confirmed for our conference. Got lucky.  Never going back to Cosmo, not even for a meal or for a stay. Fickle, arrogant, and rude defines their behavior."

The Bellagio has a special place in my heart as does the Wynn, but I feel like this hotel is more for the younger crowd.   Be DRESSED TO IMPRESS. Because you will stick out like a sore thumb if you don't! Everyone else (females) are in cute dresses, decked out in jewlery, high stilleto's with hair and makeup did... men are in their collar shirts, slacks, dress shoes, hair did too!...

Nice huge floor full of gaming options... shops... various dining options... pool... and Marquee (hella packed!!!)...   Definitely a choice to stay at on my future Vegas trip... if the Bellagio or Wynn doesn't reel me back in lol...  The crowd is youngER...

5670,train,0,"SKANKY SKANKY SKANKY or Kinky!  My mom received a free room to stay at Cosmo Hotel this past weekend and decided to give the room to me instead because when she started to play, she didn't feel comfy and it felt the gambling vibe wasn't on her side.  I was like SCORE!  When you walk inside, it looks like a million bucks.  Everything looks over the top. When we got into the room, it was like wow, this is cool.  Not as big as Palazzo but still big.  The view is AMAZING from the balcony.  It has a microwave, small fridge and dishwasher along with 2 TVs.  Its like a great place to have a party.  SKANKY OR KINKY PART: From the bedroom side, there are blinds you can lift to see a person showering or taking a bath.  You cannot even lock the blinds.  So note, if you are coming here for a bachelor/bachelorette party, there will be some type of skanky photos of you taken if you take a shower or bath. Or if you plan on filming a porno, this spot is for you.  Not great for groups but great for 2 people celebrating or if you plan on filming a porno or sex tape. HAHAHA   Their buffet for brunch is fab and tasty.  No crab legs though. $23 for weekend brunch.  Cheap eats, there is a pizzeria on the 3rd floor on the East end next to the sushi restaurant, $3 for a slice of cheese pizza.  -1 for the skanky shower situation -.5 their A/C isn't cool enough.  It only goes down to 65 degrees.  -.5 for bad gambling vibes"

4396,train,1,"I've stayed here twice, the first time was at the tail end of my honeymoon and after being in the tropics with bugs and all, I was ready to be pampered. The room was super clean and I just loved how you can go to the FS pool or Mandalay's pool. However, I would suggest settling yourself down in the FS pool since they help you find a seat, cover your chair, bring you water and occasionally they bring little complimentary treats out to the pool goers. Plus it doesn't feel nearly as crazy busy as the Mandalay pools. I would definitely stay here during the summers. This second time staying here I don't think we sprung for as expensive a room so though it was nice and clean, the TV, vanity and such were very much outdated. Wished they would redecorate the rooms a bit. Other than that it's a very nice hotel with amazing service."
6664,train,1,"My new favorite hotel in Las Vegas! Our suite had an amazing balcony with a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Very spacious with two full bathrooms and a full kitchen.

I will definitely be back to the Cosmopolitan. Many thanks for a memorable 40th birthday!"
8796,test,-1,"Meh. I have to say I've had way better, I've seen worse. This hotel was a cheap late night find off of I-10 as we traveled from California to Texas. The staff was pleasant enough, the building/rooms old but looked to be recently remodled. I do not really like hotels that are open to the outside, meaning the entry doors face out into the elements. (I prefer the entry to rooms enclosed within secured buildings.) So this made me nervous because the areas away from the lobby are not wel lit and dark. The room looked clean but very tired in my opinion with dark, worn carpet; yellowed, dirty switch plates and typical economy hotel dressings. The bathroom was freshly updated with tile, new coats of paint (in main room too), and new fixtures. But, the bathroom was not spacious at all and left a claustorphobic feeling. The clothes closet was more of a nook with a rod which was a first for me to see in a hotel... Kind of corny and cheap. The water though was nice and hot and the tub sparkly clean. The beds were firm but comfortable enough to sleep on and had stacks if feather pillows - NOT my favorite options from hotels though for sanitary reasons. The room had standard furniture with a nice HD LCDtv. The microwave was great but the fridge not very cold. The a/c was odd to control and did not want to stay on at the temp I selected (colder) but fortunately it was a cool night and we were cool enough to sleep. This room was not ""horrible"" but I just couldn't get past a dirty vibe and I personally was not at ease with the room. Like, I cringed at the idea of walking barefoot across the carpet- even though I am sure the carpet was vaccumed (too dark to tell). And, I wondered if I might wake up to bedbugs. (Envoked paranoia) So that said, the hotel is probably what you would expect from a cheaper economy standpoint but I definitely DEFINITELY would not opt to stay at this place again."

Arrived early and left my bags at the front then chilled by the pool on my laptop doing quotes for most of my first day there!  Finally broke free late in the afternoon to enjoy my vacation.

I will stay there again but next trip planning on a suite at the Wynn with the private massage table room and view of the strip at night.

2029,train,1,"Four Seasons, as expected, was fabulous and you didn't even feel like you were in LV (in light of the fact that there's no casino or smoking). We really enjoyed our stay here and everyone from the valet to the housekeeping staff were wonderfully polite and helpful. The valet staff even left us bottled water in our car for our trip home and asked if we needed any extra. The valet person that greeted us when we first got there walked us to the registration desk and made sure we were attended to before leaving.   The room was clean and fresh. We asked for extra towels and pillows and both were in ample supply. The decor was updated and modern, but still classic. We went for the least expensive room option and there was still a nice view of the Luxor, the mountains, and part of the Strip. Our toddler enjoyed the view very much. The TV had a lot of channels to choose from and the toiletries were from L'Occitane and smelled amazing. Turndown service included bottled water, which was nice and convenient.   The pool, being that it was a holiday weekend, filled up fast and there was a wait list by mid-morning. I think it would be nice if they had more shady spots as those tend to go fast but the turnover rate was generally pretty good and it was easy to change spots. The pool staff set up our chairs for us and sunscreen and aloe vera were both self service and complimentary, along with lots of iced water (that they frequently topped off throughout the day). It was also nice being able to check out the Mandalay Bay's pools whenever we wanted and there's a separate  entrance (so you didn't have to go through the hotel if you didn't want to). The pool food was average priced for a resort but the serving sizes were larger than we expected. For example, the wedge of watermelon ($10) was literally 1/4 of a huge watermelon.   Overall, the FS LV is a great value for the service and quality and we would definitely stay here again. The crowd tended to be more families and older couples and less of the drunken/rowdy people found at other hotels/resorts on the Strip."
322,test,0,"Never heard of the Montelucia before until I was invited to a 2012 New Years Eve party that my friend ordered bottle service for. After seeing how beautiful the resort was in the winter, I knew I had to book a summer staycation.   Labor Day weekend staycation - booked a room for 2 nights - Sat and Sun.   Room - stayed in a room in building 14 with views of Camelback Mountain. Room was perfection! No complaints except that the mini bar had outrageous prices. Would rather of had an empty fridge to put my own drinks in. Bed and linens were extremely comfortable. Black-out curtains allowed me to sleep in til 10 am every morning. Guests next to us apologized to us for having a party til 4 a.m. in their room but we never heard them. Super quiet room!! Patio furniture was so comfortable and we lounged each day while enjoying views of Camelback Mtn. Never turned the tv on once but used the I-Pod doc to play my music, very nice! Enjoyed a soak in the tub! Beautiful bathroom and decor.  MBar- went to sit at the bar for happy hour late Saturday afternoon and received rude, slow service. Waited 5 minutes before we were even handed a drink menu. Bartendar asked if we wanted any food with our drink order, we did not. He seemed annoyed we didn't order food. I wanted to order one more drink but got tired of waiting for the bartendar to even look up at me so we left to go order a drink by the pool where we received MUCH friendlier and attentive service. I do not recommend Mbar unless you like a pompous bartender and slow service.   Oasis Pool - did not have any issues with children being in the pool like previous reviewers. Just adults. Pool wasn't very crowded but all the lounge chairs had towels on them, there was nowhere to sit. So we sat at the only available lounge chairs which were in front of an empty cabana. Bad move! Immediatley, another guest jumped out of his neighboring cabana and started yelling at us that we could not use those chairs unless we pay $150 for a cabana rental. He kept screaming at us ""Did you pay $150! Did you pay $150?!"" I couldn't believe how rude this crazy old man was acting. We explained to him there were no available chairs elsewhere and we didn't know we couldnt' sit here. So we moved our belongings to avoid a conflict, trying to find lounge chairs available, which there weren't any. So we asked one of the waitreses where we could sit. She apologized that she hadn't had time to clean up the chairs, but found some available for us. We waited a few moments while she cleaned up the towels and left over food/drinks from the previous guests. She was very helpful but it was an annoying and awkward situation. Later, a different employee came up to us and asked that we do not harrass our guests. ????WHAT???? We did not create any conflict and left the lounge chairs when the horribly rude old man told us we couldnt' use them. Yet, we were scolded not to harrass ""their"" guests?! Pretty sure I also paid for two nights at the resort as well as drinks and food by the pool. Just because we are of a younger generation and didn't purchase a $150 cabana to use, doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated as valuable guests. I am assuming the grouchy old cabana man complained to his waiter that we were trying to sit in chairs meant for cabanans only and because we are in our 20's and he is in his 60's, we are in the wrong. We were very shocked of the mis-treatment but didn't allow it to ruin our time. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us frequently for more drinks & food. Out of all the cabanas available, only the horrible old man was using one. All of the cushy lounge chairs outside of the cabanas were not in use and we saw other guests trying to use them and being told by hotel staff that they couldn't. Yet, there were no other loungers cleaned up or available for them. I suggest that if the cabanas aren't being rented and the regular lounge chairs are full, don't make your guests move. The horrible old man isn't the resorts fault, but it was an awkward situation anyways which could have been prevented had they had available staff to keep the unused lounge chairs cleaned.  Montelucia is a beautiful place to stay. Most of the staff is friendly but a few bad ones. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd stay again. There's so many resorts that I've stayed at in the Valley that have far superior service than this 5-star resort. Just want to make a note for those staff members that are rude: Just because I'm young, don't assume that the old man in the cabana rental has more money in his bank account than I do. Treat all of your guests well!!"

I was surprise to find a mini kitchen in my room.  The staff was friendly.. The lobby is small and very welcoming. I believe check out is at noon- but if you want to check out later at 2pm- just ask if you can become a member- it'll be free.  Also, the hallways smell like cigarettes... Even in my room that was non-smoking I could smell the sent. I believe it went up the walls.   I'm giving 4 stars because the late checkout was NOT a problem... and everything was clean and new. I probably wouldn't stay here again, just because of how far it is from the strip/"
6691,train,-1,Stayed here on Memorial day weekend- friends got stuck in the elevator for an hour and a half and the hotel had the audacity to blame them for the situation. They said they would follow up but they never heard anything. The whole thing was handled  poorly and I will NEVER recommend anyone I know stay there. The only reason people stay there is because of the nightclub anyway. The room was small and the entire hotel smelled like weed. We had two different conference rooms given to us before we finally got the one we paid for with actual beds in it- overall the management of this hotel should be ashamed..I will never stay here again!

The one bad thing about this place was the girl at the front desk...when I went to check in I asked for a room with two beds (I knew they had one because I saw it on Hotels.com). She said they didn't have any rooms available. Ummm.....Hotels.com come says you have several rooms available...? Ooohhh - she says- "" we have only suites available.

The property really felt like we took a trip to another country, it was a great escape. The staff went out of their way to make sure our wedding night was special- with a rose petal turn down and champagne and chocolates waiting for us when we got to the room. They had a special going on where we received a dining credit every day so we got to enjoy breakfast daily in our room as well. (Could use it anywhere, we chose room service) It was very tasty. They also solved an issue of needing a driver for my bridesmaids and I to get to my venue in a hurry after a mix up and the cost for the SUV was very reasonable.

1070,train,0,"We were craving steak and eggs and considering it was new years eve, it was hard to get from 1 side of the strip to the other side especially since it was like 40% outside at like 1a.  So we just figured, let's go eat at TI since they had to have a place that serve steaks and eggs.  Yes, they do but it was like $19 bucks.  No $5.99 deal here.  Yes, the prices on the menu were pretty pricey.  That's why I stuck with the burger, which was a great choice since it was huge (the patty didn't even fit the bun since it was huge) and the fries were really yummy.  They did forget my ranch sauce but that's fine since I just used the ketchup/pepper sauce mix instead.  Friend ordered the regular eggs, bacon, hash browns, which were filling to him but of course, was a little pricey.  It didn't help that the restaurant was next to the pho place since going to the restrooms, you can smell it and we were thinking about changing our minds and leaving but didn't.  Service was good when we went and since it was open 24 hours, that's a plus especially with huge portions."
4468,train,1,"My first visit to the area and picked a hotel near the downtown action of Charlotte.  This Hyatt was unique for a couple of reasons: 1.  They had valet parking.  Normally, I wouldn't want to pay for parking, BUT it was freezing outside and I was glad to hand over the car to someone at the door, plus the valets in the evening and morning were very friendly.  (Valet cost $22) 2. Its a shared building.  Hotel takes up a few floors of the building and you have to take an elevator up to the hotel lobby on 7th floor.    Otherwise, pretty standard Hyatt Place.  Oh wait, I did enjoy the downtown night and morning view of Charlotte.  Clerks at the front desk were friendly and helpful."

Oh plus the front door was weird it rubs against the floor in a certain spot.   In the end if I had a choice to stay here again for free (bf's parents time share) I would stay here again, how can you beat free?

The hotel and casino has a ton of cool stuff and restaurants. The Chandelier bar was pricey but cool. Secret Pizza, while a little difficult to find at first, was probably the best pizza I've had since my last trip to NY. The Wicked Spoon had a ton of interesting options and is by far my favorite buffet in all of Vegas now!"
1889,train,1,"Obviously this place is the casino equivalent ""dive bar"", and as such you know it won't be fancy, but it's also less expensive so us regular folks can have fun too.  The only thing I did here was play Video Poker. The machines have good payouts and I had good luck, making about $10 off $20 in under an hour. My dad won $30 on slots, I think a 5c machine.  I didn't get any drinks, but cocktails were offered at least 3 times while I sat at one machine which was nice!  The only thing there I can say I didn't like was one of the padded chairs at the bank of VP machines I played at had a stain like someone wet themselves on it. Now I've heard of people doing that, sitting for hours/days and just going #1 right there... I certainly hope that's not what happened but it looks bad. I hope the staff notices and has the chair cleaned. Perception is reality they say!  Overall this is a good spot, and you don't have to walk ALL THE WAY down Fremont from where the good restaurants are to get there either."
4736,train,-1,"Esthetically, the Cosmo is the coolest looking casino on the strip right now in my opinion. But its service is hit and miss. The valet was fast and very friendly, the friendliest employees we met all weekend. Front desk was fine, not overly friendly but not rude, either. Our room overlooked the Bellagio fountain for a $25 charge and the room itself was gorgeous. However, we were charged $5 for a soda we didn't even drink, it was already missing when we came to the room. Our bathroom light was burned out and the air stayed at 75 degrees and wouldn't change when we tried lowering it. We told them about it and no one came to fix it. The weirdest thing was someone knocking on our door like a madman at 9am and then using their key to come in WITHOUT saying that they were housekeeping or anything. Luckily, we had the additional door lock on so that they couldn't open the door completely, but instead of wait 30 seconds for us to get to the door, they just left. I still don't know if it was someone who worked for the hotel or some random person who had a key to the room!   I also sent an email asking to fix an account issue with my Identity membership. It took them five days to respond and they said they didn't see any problem, but I logged in and it was still there. I loved the view and look of the Cosmo, but service was extremely disappointing considering there are so many other places to stay on the Strip with excellent service."
9472,train,0,"Located in the heart of download Cleveland, this hotel is very old but huge. The accommodations are all right, we actually found a cockroach upon arrival and the facility member came to pick it up (after a lecture about how it won't bit because it's only attracted to water...whatever). However, the front desk lady gave us a free complimentary breakfast to make up for it.   Perfect location for business events and banquet if you are looking for the grand slam feel."
4897,train,-1,"So, this review is for the horrible service I received trying to dispute a $420 overcharge today, and their technical problems that they should fix with all the money they make. Booked hotel online on cyber Monday, but their site was having a glitch, so I had to waste time to call the hotel, be on hold, let them find the problem, and confirm my reservations. Ok, fine, problem solved even though the lady said they charged me twice, but that she will fix it so that I will be charged only once.  Fast forward, went to COSMO, room was ok although for that price, the shower shouldn't have nasty water and scum stains...had fun,but just checked my cc, and they charged me again for the same charge on my checkout date. Wtf?!! So, somehow I'm assuming my payment didn't show up prepaid?! Fine! So, to fix THEIR MISTAKE, I waste MY time calling them to get my money back, and get transferred twice, talked to lady about overcharge, then she said she'll look up my account, put me on hold while they look it up. As I'm on hold, I hear the music.. music.. then clicks like someone picked up (no music), then music, then click, then ringing, then all of a sudden, ""you have reached the accounting department, and blah blah blah, CLOSE! Please leave a message.. Blah blah blah...'   Ok... Thought they may have pressed the wrong button, so hung up and called them again, and got this RUDE A$$ LADY WITH MUCHO ATTITUDE. I'm trying to explain that there was a lady helping me and put me on hold, so please transfer me back. She starts going off telling me that it's an accounting problem, they're closed, nothing they can do, probably why the girl forwarded my call to voicemail, yadda yadda yadda. IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB, THEN DON'T WORK THERE SINCE IT SHOWS IN YOUR VOICE!   3.5 stars -1 SCUM & WATER STAINS IN SHOWER -1 RUDE LADY ON PHONE, NO HELP -1 OVERCHARGING ME"

423,train,1,"Out of any luxury/resorrt hotel ive stayed at...this has probably been the best overall. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with courteous and personable staff. It was funny because my husband and I came in from the parking structure and didnt know where the lobby was from there. Someone from guest service actually came out to the courtyard greet us since we looked lost. The lobby was relatively small but elegant... its main purpose for registration and concierge.  The idea is to spend more time in the courtyards of the hotel. We were given a very nice upgrade (from standard room/no terrace to an Oasis Suite with terrace and seperate living room area. The bathroom was huge. The bed comfortable. My favorite part of the room was the extra large terrace with double lounger and patio dinimg table. Both the bedroom and living room had double sliding doors that open to the terrace. Make sure to check out the 24 our gym. It has all the best equipment and weight lifting machines, a yoga/pilates studio and even outdoor cardio machines overlooking Camelback Mountain.  From the gym you can check out Joya Spa. I believe the pools are 24 hours. The pool attendants were accommodating.  They brought us our own pitcher of ice water to our lounge and even replaced it with fresh ice water after half an hour.... Oh yeah and the music was great. They had an awesome 80s mix when I was there. The grounds are very beautiful. We stayed on a weekday in August and it was very quiet and relaxing. There are numerous outdoor seating areas, patio tables, fire pits etc to enjoy the natural beauty. The Crave Cafe has pastry and small breakfast items (scones, breakfast burritos etc). They serve Starbucks coffee there. Random, but they had the BEST blueberry muffins I've EVER had (very emphatic about the muffins).  I think what really made Montelucia a notch above any other resort Ive been to is the personal feeling of the resort. And with all the great amenitiesand services...there is NO RESORT FEE! I thought all ""resorts"" had resort fees these days. Even non resorts (e.g. Crowne Plaza) have resort fees. I usually like to stay at different places when I take trips but i probably would just stay her again if I go back to Scottsdale. It really was a magical place."
6334,train,1,"I did not personally stay overnight at this hotel.   However, my aunt was invited here as a VIP Guest, and we came to say hello to some friends, and my friend and I were ""stuck"" here for 5 hours while they gambled in the VIP room.   The Hotel: ultra modern, hip, trendy, with a crowd that tends to be more stylish and - Cosmopolitan.  Parking: my first 2 trips here I was confused with their parking, as I hate valet - waiting 15-30 minutes for your car is no bueno. However, just drive in the main enterence, and stay in the middle lane past the taxi and valet line for self-park. There's also a bridge to Aria.   Marquee: the nightclub in the hotel played mainstream house when we went, because we entered with the VIP Host, we were treated well, however, I chose to leave after 10 minutes since I wasn't in a clubbing mood.   Food: so many options! Seriously, I can recall at least 6 different restaurants. Even with a VIP comp card, I simply couldn't eat anymore. There's pizza, Chinese, American, Japanese & French.   Bars: With 3 floors of entertainment, this venue is excellent for hosting a party! I prefer the 3rd floor lounge, which is surrounded by the crystal lit by pink and red lighting on 3 floors.   Gambling: With my Chinese family that gambles a large amount of money, they again tell me the Feng Shui is designed to the advantage of the casino - however, I enjoyed my 2 days, each in 5 hour increments, at this hotel.   SHOUTOUT TO THE VIP HOSTS AND STAFF!"
2740,train,1,"This was my first time staying at the Cosmopolitan, as I usually stay at a cheaper place such as Bally's. But I got a good deal on Southwest Vacation for the flight and stay. I booked a terrace studio with a balcony and ended up being upgraded to a higher floor and then paying slightly more for a view of the Bellagio fountains. That was the best decision, because the view and my room were breath taking. I'm not kidding... I wanted to spend most of my time on my balcony overlooking the beautiful fountains, the High Roller, Paris, and the mountains. What a special treat. My room was awesome: clean and large. My bathroom was huge! A walk-in shower connected to a large two seat Japanese soaking tub with a view of the strip. So this is how the better half lives! Lol the choices for restaurants are aplenty. We had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon, and pizza several times at the Secret Pizza place. But there are also many other options within the hotel. The decor is modern and swanky. I was worried I was too old for this contemporary place, but there was a variety of people there. We even went to the Marquee nightclub for the Lebron James championship celebration (Go Cavs!) and even though the crowd was exactly what you would expect at a Vegas Club, there were some other people over 30 there to make me feel comfortable. I had great service at my check in by Jesse, and the concierge, Taylor suggested a great dinner option and made our reservation at El Dorado Cantina. The only complaint I have is regarding the mini fridge. All the food and drinks sit on censors so they can't be moved and there isn't any room for leftovers, or drinks, even though there's a microwave and partial kitchen within the room. But that's just a small complaint compared to the amazing time I had at the Cosmopolitan. I'll have to save up the money forever, but I'd love to come back again just for the amazing room and view!"

2799,train,1,"We stayed here on a recent trip to Mesa. The neighborhood is old and somewhat questionable, however the hotel is a gem. Ruben greeted us at the front desk and I liked him instantly. He obviously takes pride in his job and the hotel. The interior is nice and the rooms are recently remodeled. The bed was comfy and the room was clean..even the bathroom (which doesn't happen often in my opinion).   We stayed three nights and all was great. They offer breakfast (basic bagels, waffle fruit etc) and had a pool and probably the biggest hot tub I've seen at a hotel. The pool was refreshingly cool on a hot day and very clean. The hot tub was at the right temprature for me, but my husband said it could be warmer.  In all I recommend this place."
5779,train,1,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful! The rooms are spacious and the staff is super chic and friendly. The hotel is so beautifully designed that it's definitely worth the money to stay here. A group of five girls and I were celebrating a friend's 30th birthday and Elizabeth Diaz at the Concierge desk was beyond helpful in making reservations and helping us plan all of our activities before we arrived. You never have to leave the hotel if you don't want to as there are a number of yummy restaurants on premise. I highly recommend STK and the Wicked Spoon. The wait was a bit long at STK, even though we had reservations, but the peppercorn crusted skirt steak with asparagus was well seasoned and definitely worth the hour wait. Wicked Spoon is the buffet on premise and all of the food was so yummy that we had to peel ourselves away from the table!  If you're planning on utilizing the spa I would recommend the Sahra Hammam massage with Joe! Joe was able to work out all of the tightness in my shoulders and alleviate the pain in my lower back caused by our 5 hour plane ride from NYC. Joe applied the right amount of pressure and I would definitely recommend him especially if you carry heavy shoulder bags on a daily basis.  The 3 pools were all beautiful but I would definitely recommend getting there by 10am to grab enough chairs for more than 2 people. (The key is to just place towels on the chairs and just come back after breakfast).   The Marquee nightclub also seems like the club everyone goes to and it was a lot of fun as well. I would also recommend getting to this line early (before 11am) in order to avoid the $30 cover charge and the hour long wait. The special hotel guest line to get into the Marquee was about an hour wait as well. I don't recommend purchasing any of the club passes on the street as these promoters don't have much pull in getting you into the nightclubs for free after 11p and most clubs don't charge anything before 11p anyway.  Overall, this is definitely the place to be!!"

4827,train,-1,"Ok ok so long story but I basically ended up staying at the Hooters Casino for my last trip to Las Vegas and I was starving.  I had to stay in the casino because I was working on my midterm, anyways its all so twisted but I ended up not having a midterm.  But for the time being while I was at the casino I thought I had a midterm and this was the only available place to go.    I had a cheddar bacon burger, pina colada, buttercup pie and potato salad.  The only good thing was the potato salad. The burger was bad....lots of bbq sauce but no actual flavor. Hooters girls need a major reality check, just cuz u are wearing really short shorts and a tight top with a push up bra doesnt automatically make you hot or give you a perfect body especially not with all the flat asses walking around.  All the girls were wearing drag queen make up and most had false eye lashes.  Some of the guy cooks were actually hotter than the female waitresses, lol!  The pina colada was severly watered down.  Potato salad was really good.   I highly doubt Ill ever come back."

9025,test,-1,"Hotel Building: Outdated and smelly. Neighborhood: Ok. Close to Yonge St (like Times Square) and Church-Wellesley (trendy gay area) but is not like these area. Lot's of homeless people. Hotel Staff: Rude and incompetent. We booked through Orbitz a week out and they had no record of us. Took 30 min and 3 people for them to admit that the reservation was there but they had misplaced a fax. Meanwhile I kept having to move me car during rush hour because there was no street parking and I had to let people out of the one car drive. Several encounters with employees through out the trip did not yield better results. Rooms: 2 stars at best, seen worse but certainly wasn't good. Broken closet door and noisy air conditioner. Parking situation: They say that they have indoor parking. Here's the catch, they don't have much of it. Had to park down the street at an outdoor lot where there were a ton of shady people and signs warning not leave valuables in the car.  Overall: I don't expect much from a Best Western, but this was pretty bad."

6613,train,1,"3 nights and 4 days at the Cosmopolitan and I'm a fan.  For sure.  Our room had a balcony and all the perks you'd expect at a nice hotel on the strip.  Super comfy bed, beautiful lobby, separate shower and nice large tub, The Chandelier is gorgeous and has great drinks, of course.  There is, however, a $25/day resort fee which I was not aware of when I made the reservation on hotels.com, but that's my fault for not reading the fine print probably.  But, thanks to that resort fee, the use of the clean, state of the art gym was included with our stay.  The yoga classes were $10 each, which is not bad.  Didn't use room service but did check out Scarpetta.  FANTASTIC.  We'll definitely be going back."

We just stayed here for my girlfriends birthday last week and were ""upgraded"" to a different room than what I had booked. Sounded good at the time but what we ended up with was a room with the view of a roof (literally only 20 feet between us and the roof to Marquee[I think]) and a Japanese bathtub that was pretty awkward and uninviting. After many many great stays at the Cosmo they definitely dropped the ball this time. Time to search for the next great experience that Vegas has to offer! It's been real Cosmo."

8217,train,1,"I can't stand vegas but this hotel makes it a better experience. Beautiful rooms and if you book thru Marriott (yes) you earn points and upgrade eligibility based on your Marriott status. I've stayed here about 5 times and upgraded every time despite major conferences going on at hotel ( weekdays). Casino is dance, nice chandler bar center stage, everything is reasonable close so your not exhausted walking a vast property. Balcony with great views ( ask to face Bellagio so u can see the water show from your room). Great restaurants..ate at four while there..for a great traveler I'd suggest Eggslut for breakfast and a must find spot on 3rd floor called secret pizza....probably the most affordable best food on the strip. Only complaint my toilet in room was broken I called and it was never serviced so I listened to it run water for days...and left my $50 hot iron in room but now lost and found says it wasn't turned in. My fault but it wasn't turned in."
779,train,1,"This place has so much to offer. Let's start with the resort itself--first rate. Beyond that, the Spanish theme gives this place the perfect Old World vibe, with a touch of modern.  The Prado Restaurant has excellent fare and their wine selection is superb. The staff is professional and they go that extra mile to make your dining experience amazing.  I quite enjoyed the guitarist who played on Saturday at the M Bar as well. His ability was only matched by the variety of genres I heard: spanish, classical, jazz, Brazilian, among others. I had to give the young man a tip.  In summary, I would highly recommend Montelucia to anyone staying from out of town and also to anyone local seeking a first rate dining and entertainment experience."
5371,train,1,"The Crew and I left sunny Phoenix a day early, and after considering our options, decided to make the trek to Vegas. We rolled in on Saturday evening, with plenty of time to find a place to crash for the night. We weighed our options and decided our hotel of choice would need to fulfill three of the following key factors:  *affordability *location  *high percentage of cute girls  After stopping at Barbary Coast, The Rio, and The Palms, I remembered my time working at Hooters Grand Avenue in Milwaukee, and we all realized there was a fairly new Hooters Casino that might just fit the bill.   Well, it was affordable, at just $110 bucks on a Saturday night, and they didn't require a two-night minimum like some places do on a holiday weekend. So far, so good.   Turns out, Hooters Casino Hotel is located next to the Excalibur, New York New York Hotel, and the MGM Grand, so there was plenty within walking, er stumbling, distance.   At this point, Taylor's judgement seemed to be the least impaired (he was driving) as he didn't consume any road sodas, so it was up to him to verify the last key factor in our search. After further review, how could we *not* love the girls in their sexy Hooter girl uniforms? Didn't see any sausage, either. Only sexy ladies dealing black jack, roulette, craps, you name it.   We weren't in Vegas for an hour, and we'd already hit the Jackpot.  We checked in promptly, and headed up the room for to get settled in and form a loose plan of action for the night ahead.   After drinking and dancing at the Piano Bar and Coyote Ugly in the New York New York Hotel, we hit the gaming floor at Hooters where the cocktail waitresses kept the white russians stiff and flowing ALL night long. We didn't stop gambling and drinking until well after sunrise, my buddy Brian rolled in at 9:30 a.m. up a c-note and still drunk as a skunk. Who would've thought you could ride a 5 dollar roulette table for 6+  hours in Vegas on a Saturday night?   Overall, our stay at Hooters Casino Hotel was a great experience, with cheap rooms, clean and fun atmosphere, and it's central to the main strip in Vegas. It's a nice alternative to the usually pricier hotels like MGM Grand or The Monte Carlo, for example."
3428,train,-1,"I admit that I had high expectations for the Wyndham Grand.  I was forced to stay here for a conference, but it was a downtown rate for an old, tired, and inconvenient hotel.  There are multiple reasons for my poor rating -  Parking is inconvenient and expensive.  Only valet parking is available at $30 for the day, but they actually filled up and just told guest there was no parking with no options provided - guests were forced to wander downtown looking for parking with no idea of a good rate.  To make matters even worse (or better) I found $13 a day parking one block away that the valets did not tell me about.  The Internet in the rooms was inconsistent, slow, and prone to disconnecting for minutes at a time.  That is unacceptable for a business hotel.  The rooms are small and the bathrooms are tight with no full-length mirror available.  I know hotels have changed over the years and this is a dated hotel, but it is still inconvenient.    The meeting rooms had an extremely strong odor of must and mold that made them almost uninhabitable - gotta fix this.  The lunch I got in the restaurant took 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen after I ordered it - even then the chicken on my sandwich and my fries came out burnt.    The Wyndham was a disappointing hotel that is not worth the money or the hassle. Go elsewhere."
7627,test,1,"I've just read a review from ""Tomas"", a purported semi-high roller who complained of service during Memorial Day Weekend. Cannot comment on his situation - since it isn't mine - but I can offer a counterpoint.  We arrived and checked in at VIP Registration. While my wife grabbed some juices and sodas, I spoke to the clerk who offered a suite with a connector for my 9 year-old son. While he checked on availability, I was offered an array of alcoholic options. Although I declined, it's nice to know that champagne and such were available.  The collection of rooms was - in a word - huge. To give some perspective, I didn't know we had a third bathroom until we were about to check out on Sunday. Luxurious bedding and pillows, prompt service, and easy to use technology.  The staff - across the board - are friendly and courteous. We only had two major meals - room service and buffet Saturday night. Total cost for trip? Under $25.  The location is terrific, by the way. Easy walk to Caesar's in one direction, a short hop to MGM in the other. Who could ask for anything more?"
8191,train,1,"I haven't stayed here but I did a pretty complete walk through and this hotel is really nice. It is a little more cramped then some might be used to compared to the bigger casinos. They did however fill in what they could with the space they had. The design work of the walls and even the ceilings and light covers all look like some time was put into their design. The huge Chandelier in the center of the place is beautiful.  Being as it was cold, we were able to walk through the pool area without any problems. The pool is one of those horizon drop off pools where is just flow from each side without any noticeable ending. It was a cool touch to the pool. The chairs all around the pool are either located on the edges of it or overlooking the strip. Because the pool is on the third floor, it offers a unique pool experience that the other casinos can't.  I wish I got to spend a little more time here exploring, but I did like what I have seen of it so far."
6267,train,-1,"Worst customer service I've EVER experienced!!! I'm in Vegas often and every year I host a weekend for 30-40 friends and this year (Jan 2016) we made the biggest mistake and choose The Cosmopolitan. They have the audacity to name their Group Sales Department the Celebrations Team; however my interactions were anything but celebratory. Samantha was my initial contact (I say initial as she no longer works for the hotel) who often had a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, when she quoted me a price, I had a buddy call and he spoke to someone else who quoted a less expensive price, when I explain this to her she got furious and indicated that he would no longer be given those prices and if i didn't take her prices now then they would be no longer valid either. I unfortunately had to work with Samantha 3 weeks and during each conversation, she was rude, condescending and disrespectful. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and looked up several customer service emails and detailed my experiences with the Celebration Team and received an email from a different person, who offered nothing other than an apology.  Example: I was in the process of booking their biggest Penthouse until I was informed that outside drinks or food would be prohibited inside the Penthouse. When I asked if my kids had an ice cream cone from a business outside of the hotel what would happen, and they informed me that I would be subjected to an 18-20% penalty.  I would suggest that you book elsewhere there are plenty of great hotels right night door that will give you the customer service that was traditionally synonymous with Las Vegas."
1299,train,1,"We stayed at the hotel yesterday and were so impressed with the service from checking in, servers for the wedding reception, and the restaurant staff.   We called to see if we could check in early, and we were accommodated which was such a contrast to what we have experienced at other hotels.   The wedding reception room was small, but it fit the 80 guests who were in my family member's wedding.   The best part was the servers were amazing!!  They were incredibly helpful and they had to deal with a lot of little kids (not mine!!) running around.  I planned to leave an extra tip for top notch service, but I was told by someone that gratuity had been included in the price. I should've live $ at the table because they really were the best most patient people.   The only downfall is they put the buffet food away so quickly.  We had a late arrival, so I went to the restaurant to order food.  Wow, was it good!  We got two orders of sliders, an order of hot wings, pizza, and something else I can't remember for $47.  The food was delish.  The Mexican food that had been served for the reception was also great.   My husband and I will be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in 2 years, and we think we may come here for a small event.  Loved the food and service. I'd inquire about food being put away too quickly, but otherwise a great deal and wonderful evening provided by the staff."

I asked when it might be ready and was told that there was ""a rather long list of people waiting"" ahead of me for their rooms and that they couldn't give me an estimate.  An hour perhaps?  ""I'm not sure I could promise you that"" was the answer.  Is there anything to do here while I wait?  ""You can sit over there with the others!""  It's been more than an hour and while others have walked through the door, checked in at the front desk and been given keys to their rooms, a select few (including me) sit in the lobby...over ""with the others""!

This is a sweet, sweet resort.  Staff was fantastic--extremely friendly and accomodating.  Very helpful in directing me to my room, which is not an easy feat given that this resort is spread out over a very large area due to (as I found out) PHX-area zoning/building restrictions that limit the height of buildings.  I referred to it as a ""horizontal"" hotel vs your typical ""vertical"" hotel.  Each of the 20 or so buildings are just 2 stories, so it's a pretty serious haul from the front desk to your room.  It takes about a day just to figure out where the hell everything is, but this is not really an inconvenience because walking around and enjoying the grounds is a pleasure.  My room was at the very end of building 10, smack in the middle of the facility.  I was a bit disappointed that my sitting area bumped up directly against the corner of another building, but again not a big deal.  Internet access is included in the resort fee, but on multiple occasions I had to manually enter my name and room # to get access, as did my colleagues.  I questioned the charges and they were promptly removed, with a smile.  When my GF was arriving I called to have the bed made and housekeeping arrived literally less than a minute later.  Nice.  Fresh-brewed hibiscus tea in the lobby.  The pricing at the spa is exorbitant, but my girlfriend discovered that the spa is open to everyone, including a very nice sauna/hot tub, arctic plunge area with fresh fruit, etc.--free of charge.  THIS ISN'T OBVIOUS and if she hadn't checked it out I never would have known so just march on in and enjoy.  I'm lazy but apparently the gym was also very nice.  Food was excellent but (like everything else) very, very pricey, none of which is unexpected at a resort of this caliber.  I would highly recommend staying here particularly if your company is picking up the tab. :-)"
3330,train,-1,"They charge me for the time I did not stay even though I cancel my reservation. Very rude staff and the hotel condition is very bad, they don't clean everyday. It's bad location, there is nothing around as far as places to eat or get any services. It's not safe place to stay."
2692,train,1,"Quiet!  Outstanding service  Concierge is phenomenal, will secure reservations for anything, even if ""booked"" or ""sold out"" to the public. We had to meet some friends at Tao at the Venetian on a busy night. The line to get in was an hour or more. One quick call to the Four Seasons Concierge resulted in the Tao manager coming outside the club within 5 minutes to allow us immediate admission. Secured us reservations at Joel Robuchon with 2 days notice. Just phenomenal.  NO WAIT FOR TAXIS  In a city of herd mentality and herd treatment, the Four Seasons is a welcome respite."
2884,train,-1,"We did not stay here.... we arrived to eat at Hooters inside the hotel at midnight after a UFC fight.  There were over 10 people standing in line (as directed by the signs to do) to be seated....and an empty restaurant.   The two hostesses were completely oblivious to everything going on around them.  People started walking up to the hostess stand and were being immediately seated. After seeing this happen several times, the large group (8-10) in front of us gets mad and leaves. I approach the hostess stand,  ask about the wait time and am told there isn't one.  I point out the line of people who had been waiting and ask when we'll be seated.   I can tell she's confused but she apoligizes and tells us that we'll be seated immediately.  A few minutes later, the hostesses are still standing there looking at each other, people in the line are mad and loudly complaining about the wait at an empty restaurant. We gave up and left without ever being seated."
3120,train,1,"LOVED this hotel.  Definitely the vies for one of the top hotels.  I told them that I was pregnant and my toddler was going to be staying with us prior to arrival.  They were SO sweet to her the entire time.  It was a great experience.  There were extra pillows on the bed, so I slept better than I had in the past 6 months.  The room was child proofed and they sent a sweet treat to our room shortly after we were settled.  The pool was fantastic and I loved that there was a quiet separate entrance.  Such a great experience, can't wait to return again."
9978,train,1,"Great hotel, and if you're in Madison for a Badgers game (Go Bucky!), the location can't be beat (it's right across from Camp Randall).   Small, modern, boutique hotel, with nice amenities and an incredibly wonderful staff. We were given an early check-in and late check-out without any problem.  For starters, they offer free parking AND free wi-fi, so right off the bat, I'd be inclined to stay here over most other places in the area. They also offer a free shuttle service to anywhere within a three-mile radius. That certainly comes in handy as there can be some difficulty in parking in Madison. We used the shuttle to go to the Farmers' Market and it worked out perfectly.  The hotel is pet-friendly, and there's a bowl of treats and  a ""welcome"" sign with your pet's name on it in the lobby. I thought that was super cute. I imagine on a busy day, the sign would say ""Welcome Sparky, Lucy, Hunter, Fluffy, Charlie, etc.""  The room itself was wonderful. There's a small kitchenette with a two-burner range, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator and REAL dishes, silverware and glassware. They even had champagne glasses so we could enjoy our Veuve Clicquot properly. The honor bar features locally made products and liquors.(I so wanted to scoop up the adorable mini bottles of Death's Door gin and vodka, but at $11 apiece, I decided against it.)  The bathroom had a separate toilet area, which is always appreciated, especially when you're not traveling solo. The European Spa shower was pretty amazing too, once I figured it out. There were so many handles and levers, that at first I thought I was in an airport hangar and not a shower.   The rooms have concrete walls and floors so the floor can get chilly, but they offer complimentary slippers to all guests. There's a small fitness center on the premises and complimentary grocery pick up from a local store. Be sure and check out ""The Wise,"" the hotel's restaurant and bar for some tasty vittles and cocktails. There's even an outside patio that I can't wait to check out in the summer.  The only negatives I have would be that for a hotel that prides itself on being ""green,"" it was dismaying to see the dishwasher running when we checked into our room, but with no dishes at all inside. And despite hanging our towels up after use so they wouldn't be replaced (as instructed), we still were given new towels. I also didn't like the fact they only had Coffee-Mate creamer and not ""real"" cream--we're in Wisconsin! If you're going for an upscale feel and have Keurig brewers in each room, then methinks you should not have imitation dairy products. I realize I'm probably splitting hairs, but I just can't stomach non-dairy creamer in my morning joe.  I loved this hotel and it's definitely going to be our first choice when staying in Madison. Of course, I may feel differently staying here during a Badgers home game, because I imagine it's an entirely disparate experience.  4.5 stars."
9622,train,1,"I've stayed in a lot of average hotels with my work, and this, believe me, is a way better than that.  For the price, this is a really good choice. It's not in a dream location, but hey, get an uber!  Lovely swimming pool, crazily cool rooftop hot tubs, great breakfast, good rooms, friendly staff.  What's not to like."
8504,train,-1,The rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room.  1 Wacom tablet and mouse 1 button down shirt (yes a shirt!).    only noticed the shirt missing then when I returned home noticed that my Wacom tablet was missing as I needed to edit some images. I only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me (it's a messenger bag).   Waiting to hear back from the hotel...if it's not what I want to hear then I'll file a policy report. I fault myself for not noticing right away but I've never ever had this happen to me before. Not good times.
8826,train,-1,"The location is good, as it is about a mile or so away from the strip. The room is a ""suite"". We had the double queen room. There was a kitchenette (stove, microwave, sink and kitchen cabinets), the bathroom was not too small and there is a preroom between the kitchenette (which is a corner of the sleeping area) and the bathroom.  The room is somewhat old (the kind of old that makes it seem as though it is not very clean). In the morning it kinda stank of pee or stale water (I wonder if the heat made things smell a little).   The staff was very helpful. Free internet means that they give you an Ethernet cable that you connect to your computer.  I am giving them an extra star already, just for being nice and in a good location"
7566,train,1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. All the rooms are superb!! Great service every time. Anytime I visit Vegas, this is my choice of hotel. This place is fun, intimate, crazy, sexy. I invite friends to visit and their always blown away. I've stayed in the One bedroom studio and plenty of nights in the Wraparound Suite. I hate leaving the place too. It's just something about waking up and heading out to the balcony to take in the scene."

9940,train,1,"No questions, this was the best hotel experience, EVER.  We stayed in a single bed room, which also had a sofa sleeper, and had more than enough room for the two of us.  The urban, metro, and euro design were well incorporated, and the multiple jet body shower was to die for.  With the kitchenette this felt more like a rented loft and less like a hotel.  The staff were impeccable and tended to our every need, including resolving an issue with another room on the floor whose guests were smoking weed in the room/building.  The cordial staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable, and they did just that.  The recommendations for restaurants were great and the complimentary shuttle made getting to and from downtown Madison a breeze.  My only suggestion to the management would be to have the custodial services staff follow the ""green"" procedures of not replacing towels which were hung to dry.  A minor request which in no way significantly marred our experience.  An overwhelming thank you to all of the staff who made our six night stay memorable.  There will be no need for us to find a different hotel the next time we are Madison, HotelRed will be our destination of choice!"

In fact, that's my beef with this place.  It's a hipster's paradise.  Younger crowd.  The girls are all living out some Sex and the City fantasy.   The boys are trying their best to be cool. The one positive... hot cocktail waitresses (though Bellagio is still my favorite).     Not a fan.  If you're in your 20's, though... you'll probably want to stay here."

Got to experience the west tower now and although its the tower away from the strip I enjoyed the view , will be coming back hopefully in november!

189,train,-1,"Three stars for the hotel room quality, four stars for the check-in staff, one star for the food quality, point five for the food service. (Reverse those last two if you wish.)  An okay place to stay, just don't get stuck eating here.  You are better off going to Wendy's in Terminal three than subjecting yourself to the dubious food, indifferent service and ridiculous prices of the Gateway restaurants.  I ate two poor to mediocre dinners here, both with tabs in excess of $50 including tax and tip.  Gluey soup, microwaved bread, pizza crust reminiscent of cardboard. (Worse than the frozen pizzas you buy for your five-year old.) The spicy pretzel mix at the bar was the culinary highlight of my visit."
1865,train,1,My wife and I went to Vegas for our anniversary. We picked the Four Queens for the reasonable price. It was a nice place nothing fancy but for the price it was well worth it. The one bad thing was we reserved a smoking room and when we got to the room we found out it wasn't. When I called the front desk they told me they didn't have any. We did finely get one the next day so not too big a deal. I suggest you pay the $15 when reserving if it is important to you.   All the people who worked there were very nice. We saw the Mike Hammer show witch was very enjoyable. Hugo's cellar was wonderful. The cocktail waitress were very attentive we were never without a drink while we were gambling.     I would recommend the Four Queens for a nice place to stay.
7145,train,1,"Gorgeous, simply beautiful. Modern elegance, this is for sure one of the new highlights on the strip. The chandelier breathtaking, the shops and restaurants, nightclubs, everything is carefully selected and top notch. Had I not had a bad dining experience here it would be 5 stars, this is where the young, hot rich elite stays, get a piece of the pie and enjoy a stay here it will be memorable for sure."
7812,train,1,"I'm not a hotel snob, but I can definitely see myself being one in Vegas after staying at the Cosmo.  I'm usually the travel on a budget kind of guy, so this was a little indulgent, but I was dying to stay here and I was super duper impressed.  Now, a parking garage is usually not that interesting.  Leave it to the Cosmo to win your affections with trendy wall art by Obey and parking spot indicators to let you know open spaces available.  If there is a red light over the spot- it's taken, green of course means, go.  No more circling the lot hoping to find the closest opening like an idiot.  Unless you're colorblind, this was a genius idea.  From the moment you walk into the hotel, you know this is going to be an experience unlike anything else.  First, the air is not stale and smokey.  Instead, it smells fresh and clean and you don't feel like your suffocating in a chain-smoking old lady's car.  That not enough?  Visual displays line the walls with cool artwork and the furniture looks as if you're in a loungey nightclub versus a hotel.  Just speculation, but this could be one of the main reasons why the demographic of the patrons seems to skew younger.  Not rowdy fraternity type, but more like younger businesslike professionals.  A nice hotel room to me is the Monte Carlo, so this was a huge upgrade.  We got a Terrace Suite and OMG.   A living area, a bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and walk in shower with seating, flatscreen televisions in your living room and bedroom, a plush micro-fiber L-shaped couch, a full work area, half kitchen, a private balcony overlooking the strip and a bed that felt like clouds.  It took every ounce in my being to not leave the room during the stay.  If you're the clubby type, they have Marquee, a popular Vegas hotspot right on premises.  During the day, the pool definitely fills up as top-40 gets blasted over the speakers.  We didn't get a chance to try it, but the Cosmo's buffet, Wicked Spoon,  is supposed to be one of the best in Vegas.  I will definitely have to check it out upon my next visit!  I highly recommend this hotel.  We found decent rates during the week by booking through their website."
8226,train,1,"Beautiful hotel centrally located on the Vegas strip. We had a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains from our room. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, spacious, and decorated with a modern flare.   The hotel is modern in design and feel; very much a nod to the new Vegas experience. I loved the sparkle, especially at the Chandelier Bar. Plenty of space to move around and easy access to the strip."
2316,test,1,"Always a Hooters fan. Rooms are decent for the price. Nothing luxury. If you are looking for cheap and close to the strip, then this is your spot. Also if you love hot wings, then the 24 hour hooters restaurant downstairs is the spot to be!"
690,train,1,"AWESOME hotel, fantastic location!    Came here recently, celebrating an anniversary. It was our first night away from our toddler and it was perfect. I told the hotel this in advance when I made my online reservation and I was delighted to find chocolate covered strawberries in our room waiting for us, along with a note from the manager congratulating us.  The room was HUGE! The bathroom is to die for. Heated floors, the BEST shower head I have ever experienced. It felt like a massage on the back of the shoulders.  There is a mini-bar in the rooms and plenty of storage space. I've never actually seen so much storage space, it was a nice surprise. There is an in room safe too.  Robes in the bathroom.    The location is perfect for going to a Bluejays game or Second City (which is what we did). Lots of restaurants around. The hotel had a little cafe, Senses. The only thing we got from here was coffee and BEWARE - if I have one complaint it's that their coffee sucks. It was actually the new low bar for us for coffee, we used to use a place we had coffee in the San Juan Islands as our worst coffee experience but Senses has that ""honor"" now. It was one sip and then toss the cups, it was so gross (we had it to-go).  So don't do that, I'm sure if you look hard enough you'll find a Timmy's or Starbucks.  They have a Chinese restaurant too, it looked pretty dead on the Saturday night we were there (meanwhile, Walburgers had an hour long, standing line wait).  I don't care for Chinese food so we didn't try there.    Despite their coffee being heated piss and Walburgers having a long wait I would absolutely stay at this hotel again. The service is awesome.  When we first came their parking garage was completely full because there was a baseball game going on nearby and we told the manager we had no place to park our car so he GAVE UP his own personal space in the garage so we could park.  I've never had a hotel do that before, they usually consider things like that to be your problem, not theirs.  So yes, our next trip to Toronto (and we live in the Buffalo area, we are certain to return) we will be coming back here.  Edit from 9/28/15 : someone from this hotel either used our credit card or sold the credit card info. We used our AmEx at this hotel and ONLY this hotel during the last 2 months and suddenly after we stayed here, we started getting all these fraud charges on it. Because we don't use the card it was very easy to trace where the info was stolen from.  Just a heads up if you stay here, watch your credit card statements because someone who works at this hotel is dishonest."
1080,train,-1,"There is something about casino restaurants that I don't understand. Why, even when you're slow, only have one person serving food AND alcoholic drinks when you have 2 people manning the minimal entrance line, 3 people serving drinks and then letting you know they aren't allowed to bring the alcohol? What's the point of that? It slowed down our service by half an hour. What if a casino's goal is to get you gambling ASAP, but you're stalled by the terrible service? Hmm...  The food wasn't that great either. I expect to pay a lot anywhere I go in Vegas, but I at least expect you to go above the expectation of any restaurant. I might as well have gone to Fridays."
421,train,1,"Great hotel. I stayed there for two days and really enjoyed it. The pool is very nice, the breakfast is great and the view is beautiful. and I loved the room service. It is pricey but worth the money. I also got a massage at the spa which was awesome; best massage I have had in a long time."
9948,train,1,"This is the most interesting and inspiring hotel I've ever encountered.  It is an ultra-modern hotel with suites that range from studios to two bedrooms.  They have done away with every depressing aspect of chain hotels, like old musty carpets and oceans of beige decor.  It feels like a swanky urban loft with ultra modern showers, European beds that are at the same time soft and supportive, state of the art electronics and great WiFi.  Because of the small scale, staff are extremely attentive.  This is what the 'W' aspires to be but falls short.  All hotels should be this way!"
6338,train,0,"My first trip to Vegas was for work. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the Hotel. Its modern and hip and located right in the middle of the strip.   The check in process was strange. When I arrived at the counter the girl asked for a credit card for incidentals, which I provided. She then asked did I want to ""upgrade"" for $60? I said what do I get for $60? she said we can upgrade your room.  I said upgrade my room for $60 total? She said no, $60 a night.  After I declined she asked me to initial the box on the monitor in front of me that I agreed to pay a $28 dollar a day resort fee. I asked what does the resort fee cover? She said use of the gym and wireless internet.  I asked if it was optional, she said no.   So why not include it in the rate?   After I checked in I had the opportunity to walk the hotel. Its beautiful. My room was spectacular with a great view of the Bellagio. The Hotel had some cool bars in it and also a couple good restaurants. Accessing the strip was a breeze just walk through the casino and your there. The valet service was great, really friendly and knowledgeable about the city.   Stay was good but at check out it kinda went sideways again. Front desk informs me we have mini bar charges. I'm positive I didn't and told her so and she removed them form the bill but this happened to all 11 people I was traveling with.   all in all Nice Hotel in a great location. I would return."
1393,train,-1,"I did not bitch it up to the manager. Just to clarify. I was very calm and spoke only the facts. That the bill showed we came at 945am when we were there prior to 9am because we had all looked to see how long before the Mirage pool opened (10am).   We were all having a good time, excited that we would get protein and I was going to get pancakes as well. Imagine, pancakes after south beach. I was working hard so this utlra-non food was going to be perfect to a day of lounging followed by crazy walking up and down the strip.   We started noticing that 3 tables who came later than us (way later, like after we had long placed our orders) were getting their food and exiting!  The server who gave us the liquids changed to another lady who seemed strung out and over worked but seriously, who complains before getting the food unless you're okay with spit and bodily fluids not from your own body. She had a stack of bills in her hands and were inputting info into the computer. We doubted that she even entered our order at one point.   Another lady from the counter got up to complain and it was obvious that we weren't the only ones fuming with empty stomachs.  To be honest, the food was pretty good except I recall someone complaining about some processed cheese but I was in already in food-coma to pay attention. After we ate, I was ready to complain. Two people of our party quickly made their exit but come on, I wasn't going to make a scene.  I found a manager who looked like she had something going on upstairs and explained all the facts. The waitress came over and confessed that she was having a hard time with ONE (1) customer (at the counter) and hence, she was slow in filling orders. ONE customer caused this.  The manager was only able to comp us 50% but that was good enough since our belly was filled.   No tips and we never went back."
2302,train,0,"My coupons for free match play and slots disappeared from the black jack table while I was in the rest room! Also MIA was my coupon for free chicken wings! So there are some really pretty women walking around in their sexy outfits, I have had much better luck with cards at the Indian casino. The room was clean and the view of the large hotels was intriguing, but on a separate visit I got a room on the other side and it was of the airport and some AC units in disrepair on a roof, kind of depressing. I will go again because the girls are so pretty and I did leave some extravagant tips due to their friendliness and quick service."
8375,train,1,"Came here with three others 6 days after they ""soft"" opened. It's a gorgeous space, what little of it there is! Our visit began in the parking garage, which was difficult to turn into heading east on Sahara. The elevators are hidden behind doors, which is unusual for a casino garage. We didn't think the signs were correct for the elevators at first. Lots of others have pointed this out as well.   Upon first glance inside, it's an intimate place for sure. The decor struck me as Wynn-esque, and it wasn't busy on this Friday evening. We sat at the (one) casino bar, located centrally in the casino. It was all shiny & clean, like all casino bars should be! Bartenders were cordial and quick to assist. I ordered a lychee martini with no prompting, and it was heavenly!  There is my reason to return. I didn't see any cocktail menus and forgot to ask for one. I didn't join their players' club because I'm hoping they will have a great locals offer to join sometime soon."
3597,train,-1,"This place is a Goofy as a Maroon Five song. Next time I meet someone at the Tropicana, I'll pick the bar/restaurant. The wings were small and the girls were trying too hard. Next time, I'll wait in my car. Dont waste your time..."
884,train,0,"First time here and I was really excited to stay here. What a disappointment from the call for the van. As we found out later, it only takes six minutes to get to the airport with moderate traffic. When we called we were told the van was waiting for us. We ran into others who were waiting before us and twenty minutes later, a half hour for them, the van finally showed up. Then we get to the front desk and tell them who we are. No smile, no hello, just 'we don't have you listed.' While we were trying to figure out how to fix the problem, all she kept saying was they never got our listing and it had happened before. No assistance in fixing the problem. Then while I was sleeping I was woken up by two maids talking between two rooms. When asked to keep it down, they were quiet for a short time and then decided to stay a while to vacuum right in front of my room. But all is not lost. Our pick up van was right on time. The driver, Eric, was awesome! Genuinely friendly and great smile. So I'll give this place another chance. There's gotta be more like Eric there that maybe we'll see next time."
2475,train,1,"Sometimes when you're in Vegas you just have to get away from all the crap that is the STRIP and head downtown. **Downtown Where the folks are broke. Downtown Where your life's a joke. Downtown When you buy your token, you go Home to skid row**  My friend has been to vegas sooo many times but he never had been to downtown.. **Downtown Where the cabs don't stop Downtown Where the food is slop Downtown Where the hop-heads flop in the snow Down on Skid Row**  So we headed down there.  If you have been to Hollywood and seen all the knock off weird people who dress up as second rate children's characters (ex. Sponge Bob , Batman..etc)...then you are right at home since its almost the same here. There are some sketchy characters here.........  We went to the Four Queens Hotel because that was where my friends' parents had gotten married and stayed about 35 years ago and he wanted to check it out. Its a decent hotel.   They have blackjack switch!! I won $100- here. That alone makes this hotel worth my time!    The dealer was very nice!   Its nice to see cheap tables.  $5- blackjack as opposed to $15+ on the strip!"
5718,train,0,"Very nice place for a conference or business meeting. I recommend the rooms at the 27th floor or higher facing the Bellagio. One of the best views I've ever experienced. Very stylish and comfortable rooms. Fully equipped with dishwasher, sink, fridge and microwave. Bathrooms are world class."
5385,train,-1,"This place is dirt cheap!!! The parking lot is scary as heck.  There is a very small self-park lot out front and a garage adjacent to the hotel.  The garage is very high - maybe like 7-8 stories but is so freakishly small.  After spending 10 minutes try to find a parking spot on the 7th floor, my friends and I enter the elevators and pray not to die as the shaft is shaking and making funny weird noises.  Besides praying for our safety,    we are holding our breath because there is a smell combination of vomit, urine, and shit - no kidding!  Anyways, besides the parking situation, the casino is small and decent.  They were running this suited blackjack promotion where if you got a suited bj, you got a free Rush Hour 3 DVD.  My friends and I ended up winning around 10 and selling them to tourists from Canada for a few bucks.   Moving on, I did not stay in their hotel rooms but based on the casino, I would much rather go somewhere else unless its free.  There's no reason to come to Hooters besides to eat their fat inducing hot wings.  There is also no ""eye-candy"" here... if you want to see very beautiful cocktail waitress go to Bellagio or Wynn."
6225,train,1,"If you happen to find a good deal to stay at The Cosmopolitan, then go for it even if it's just for one night. Staying here is worth every penny. I found a good deal for the Terrace Suite, and the room was amazing! This one-bedroom, two-bath hotel room was very spacious. It had a full kitchen complete with a microwave, oven, stove, refrigerator, freezer, and mini-bar area. It also had a small dining room area with a booth and a wooden table. The living room was comprised of a blue velvet sofa, flat-screen TV, and desk area. The hotel room also comes with a huge balcony which means you have a lot of space to throw a party if you wanted to. You also get a view of the Bellagio fountains. The bedroom area comes with a huge, comfortable King-sized bed and a reclining sofa. It also comes with another flat-screen TV. The larger of the two bathrooms was huge! It comes with 2 sinks, a large shower, and a large bathtub that has jacuzzi sets. Having your very own jacuzzi in your own hotel room was very relaxing! The bathrooms also comes with amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, toothpaste, and toothbrush. The room is also very high-tech. You just hit one button to turn on all of the lights and another button to turn off all of the lights in the entire hotel room. The closet also has bathrobes that you can use and complimentary slippers.  The Cosmopolitan is also has an excellent location. It's right next to Bellagio so you can take pictures at the Conservatory. It's right across the street from Planet Hollywood. You can talk a walkway to get there and go shopping at the Miracle Mile Shops. The Cosmopolitan also has Wicket Spoon which is one of the best buffets on the Vegas Strip. It's so convenient to stay here. I would love to come back here again. I didn't get to use any of their pools but I did take a look at them. If you want to get the Boulevard pool, you have to use the elevator at the Eastside Tower. If you want to use the Bamboo pool, you have to use the Westside Tower elevators. The entrance of the Comospolitan turns into a lounge at night with live music and dancers. The lighting effects look really cool."

They have balconies here which is great. Request a room over looking the Bellagio fountains. We come to Vegas very often and I finally made it to the Cosmo last month. So glad I did. See you in three weeks! I'll be back for my Bday! Ow, ow!"
3042,train,0,"Review just for the hotel, didn't gamble.  I've heard horror stories about the rooms here from a couple of different people. But ... $29 a night on Hotels.com on a slow week, plus no resort fee, plus a $15 dining credit thrown in, plus nights count toward the freebie night ... my cheapo blood couldn't resist giving it a try.   If you get a cheapo deal you will land in the North Tower most likely, which is the one immediately on Fremont, which is why the rooms are so cheap. One side is right near the booming Fremont speakers and light show that blare on the hour every hour from about 8 PM to 2 AM every night, but even the opposite side of the hall gets a good amount of the noise too. They left earplugs in the room for a reason! Noon checkout so you can get a little more sleep.   If you can deal with the noise (or just stay up till 2 AM then sleep in), though, otherwise I actually found the room to be surprisingly clean and well taken care of, it looks like they are really making an effort to keep the place up as best they can. Even had a coffee maker with plenty of coffee, wasn't expecting that at all. TV selection is expectedly crummy, just broadcast channels with CNN and the two ESPNs, but you expect that going in with any Vegas casino-hotel. Of course, no resort fee means no free WiFi either, so this only works well if you bring your own or really don't need it."

However, on this particular hot day when all I want to do is get in my room pee & take a shower my key does not work; although I reserved my room until Monday night. Conveniently, security shows up 6-7mins later & says it's my fault for keeping my sensitive key near my phone (not true been in my soccer bag all wknd). I tried calling management & after 20mins no success. Please, these people don't care about guest service. Don't waste ur time."
7382,train,1,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay. Mixed business with pleasure. Our terrace studio was absolutely amazing. Good size room with a huge bath and Japanese style tub overlooking the Vegas lights. It included a good size balcony overlooking one of the pools in the west end. The rooms have robes and slippers, a large couch. It was very comfortable and trendy. The Belmont convention hall was upscale as well. I've been to many conventions in Vegas and none of the exhibit halls were as nice as this one (not even Bellagio or Ceasers) they are all run down compared to Cosmo. Also, the food in the convention hall was TOP NOTCH, I'm used to not so good food being served at these conventions and all of the staff, from the bell desk to the convention hall were also AWESOME!"
9945,test,1,"I have a thing for boutique hotels. I like the experience of something unique. So unless the price is way out of line that's what I look for.   The name first got my attention because red is my favorite color. I honestly was impressed in several ways.   1. The shower. Someone else mentioned it but it earns 5 stars by itself. In hotel showers I often do not feel completely clean because you don't have a lot of control over where the water goes. This shower was wickedly awesome! Between the 30 streams on your hair and the 6 side jets and the hand wand, it was just great.   2. The desk didn't make me feel like I needed a booster seat to use my computer. I'm not a very tall woman, and I'm often not comfortable sitting at a hotel desks. Here I was. (Wifi is free, but does require a password. I'm okay with that, but saw another reviewer who wasn't.)  3. Bed was not hard as a rock and pillows were not these tiny flat things. Bed was decently comfortable with quality sheets that did not feel like sandpaper.   4. Coffee maker was a Keurig. Would have been nice to have filters available down at the desk so you could make better quality coffee than the provided but it's a cut above the usual.   5. Did I mention the color scheme was black and red and rocks?  6. Nice kitchen area.  Okay the less impressive:  1.  Parking totally sucked. Got back from my meeting in Verona on Thursday and there was no where to park.  2.  In addition, you have to walk up a steep ramp from the underground parking when you do park there, not friendly to older, less fit bones.   3.  Least comfortable thing in the suite was the couch. It was okay, but not really great.   Overall, I'd stay here again in a heart beat."
5623,train,1,"PROS: - My hotel room had a balcony overlooking the strip, which was above the Boulevard Pool.  So free balcony seats during the Kid Cudi concert on Friday night.  Bonus! - The elevators require a room key to be usable, which kept the ratchets away - The pool was also only accessible by presenting your room key.  Guest only pool = see above - The parking garage is state of the art, which had red and green lights above each parking spot to let ya know that there was a space available - Secret Pizza was just downstairs and was open til 5 am.  Who doesn't love a good slice of pizza after a shenanigan-filled evening?  CONS: - There were a lot of obnoxious groups roaming the casino floor on Saturday night, which was a minor inconvenience at most  Definitely staying here again."
9655,train,1,"People come to the Jockey Club expecting the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio service and amenities, but that's unrealistic.  I am rating this place not for the amenities or the rooms themselves, I'm rating it 4 stars based on its VALUE.  This place is an amazing location (between Cosmo and Bellagio).  Few flight of stairs and an elevator ride, you're in the gambling area of the Cosmo.  Parking is FREE (which is a rarity in Vegas) and the rooms are clean.  They're not modern or WOW, but they're all suite-style and they all have a full kitchen/fridge.  Compared to other hotels in the area which were all running at $300-400 a night, I only paid $130.  Talk about a steal!  Definitely will stay again.    The only downfall is the fact that you have to go through a smoking area to get anywhere.  If you can't stand smoke, it sucks."
331,train,1,"Note: Have not stayed at the resort, my only experience was to walk around the premises and have brunch at Prado Restaurant.

9782,test,-1,"This hotel will inspire two things that I detest: leaving one-star Yelp reviews and typing extended segments in ALL CAPS. I know that all caps is the INTERNET EQUIVALENT OF SCREAMING, but, you see, I am EXCEPTIONALLY ANGRY about MONEY BEING STOLEN FROM ME.  Priceline is partly to blame here, and I'll contact them with my concerns, but when your two-star hotel is listed in their Express Deals (a service through which one can book hotels by price, service level, and area without yet knowing the specific hotel) as ""pet friendly,""  one does not typically even consider a $100 NONREFUNDABLE SURCHARGE, for any stay, of any duration, with said pets to be included in this ""pet friendly"" definition. It was a $55-a-night room special, meaning that, in all seriousness, the nonrefundable incidental for traveling with my two small, harmless dogs who did not befoul or otherwise damage the room in any way was THE F*CKING EQUIVALENT OF TWO ADDITIONAL NIGHTS' STAY.   So, besides the constant panhandling immediately outside the hotel door from vagrants staying at the adjacent Salvation Army shelter, the perpetual smell of Subway in the halls wafting up from the restaurant underneath the upper floors, the sealed-off fire escape door on the ground floor (hello certain death in the event of a fire!), the exceptionally slow and useless wi-fi, and the fact that COMFORT INN WILL STEAL $100 FROM YOU IF YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH PETS, this place was okay: nice room (with jacuzzi, min-fridge and microwave), nice staff, continental breakfast with scrambled eggs included, and great location immediately on Playhouse Square.   But seriously, the hidden pet fee is utterly larcenous and unethical, a deal breaker in every conceivable way. If they can charge $100 on a $55 stay, what is the limit at which Priceline will de-list them? $500? $1000? I adopted one of my dogs from the pound for less than what we were charged to keep them at this Comfort Inn for three days. I will probably investigate to see keeping this much additional cost below board is even legal."

3210,test,-1,"Jasmine was extremely helpful at checkin.  She was very accomodating and friendly.  However when I called the next day to inquire if this hotel had room service, I was told flatly, ""no."" by a woman at the desk. Room service is a must for me when I'm traveling, so a hotel that doesn't have it alone took off several stars off this review.  Because of this, I had to get in the car and drive out to get a steak dinner, then brought it back to the hotel only to see they have forgotten utensils.  The ones the front desk provided were plastic, and did not cut my steak.  They don't have silverware at this property, either. The hotel is dark and needs an update.  Won't be staying here again. The tactless woman at the front desk earned it 2 stars.  Thank you to Jasmine for her manners and hospitality, however.  If I could, I would yelp her and give her 5 stars."
2936,train,0,"This is our second time staying at this hotel while visiting Vegas- the first since it's been remodeled. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it only earned 3 stars because the new pool area earned the third.  Pros:  it's just on the backside of the strip, not far from MGM and Tropicana. If you don't mind a little extra walking, it's in a great location, especially for the price. The rooms have improved tremendously and are nicely redone. Spacious as well. There are also some joining rooms. Clean New pool area is great. It's smaller than many in the area, but they make up for it with games (beer pong, throwback games like hungry hippo, cards against humanity, and many more). It's full service and has indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a DJ from 1-6 on the weekends.   Cons: The AC in our first room sounded like it was going to bust. It clanked and was awful. We ended up in a second room (couldn't stand the noise and wanted to be closer to our other party, as they were on a different floor). AC was fine, but our room reeked like weed. It's legal in NV, but they are no smoking rooms.  The entire 6th floor smelled like weed the entire stay (7 nights). Our party moved because they had an issue with moths coming through their vent. They had a dozen in one night.  There is no fridge of microwave in the rooms, but there was before the remodel. Now they have to be rented per day. A fridge was $25 alone! You can't bring any outside beverages or food to the pool. You have to purchase theirs.    The customer service was okay. They moved us no problem and our other party, but they didn't really seem overly concerned about anything. They offered to let us move with the whole weed thing, but that would be room two, so we opted not to. They noted our stay to reflect my complaint so I wasn't charged the fee and we were not charged."
4398,train,1,Great Hotel   Need to have more then one hotel car.   I had my 17 year old son go down early Saturday morning around 8 am and I told him just ask for the car to take you to the golf course.  When he went down he waited 10 minutes only to have the driver and staff tell him just to get a taxi because they have more guests that are going to need to use the car. Mind you this is already after he waited. He was waiting and a group of four came down and the driver told him if he wants to wait another 20-30 or but he will give him a ride.  Just do to the fact he is younger does not mean you should brush him off.  He will remember that and some day he could be a future guest with his own kids.

But it has cheap drinks (they even have one of the giant take-home cups for $7), the funniest bartenders on the entire strip, and the biggest collection of freaks at the tables. It is just neat to be able to play and literally watch people walking by on the strip. If you want run-down w/ worse lighting and crappier service, you can go next door to circus circus or cross the street to riviera."
5386,train,-1,"Horrible,horrible,horrible! Valet only had one guy working and he was rude and not helpful. We asked for a bell cart and no one helped us with our bags.  Check-in at the front desk was bad. The young lady was not kind at all. We requested the highest floor possible and she told us she only had the twelfth floor available and said everything else was occupied. We had some friends meeting us so I also asked if there were more rooms available on that floor close to each other. She said that they did have rooms available and all our friends needed to do was request the same floor. Upon entering our room there was a horrible stench and lots of nasty stains on the carpet that looked like dried up vomit. The lamp shades where all broken and the A/C was old school and made a lot of noise. When our friends arrived they were assisted by the same woman who assigned them the nineteenth floor after stating she no longer had available rooms on our floor. She lied to us about not having rooms available on a floor higher than the twelfth! Not that big of a deal, but nonetheless annoying. Besides that it took about an hour and about three phone calls to get our luggage up to our room!   The Hooter's restaurant had roaches climbing up the walls!No joke!Even the staff saw them and didn't do anything about it. This hotel/casino is pretty run-down. The only positive side to my stay was the pool area. There are three pools in the same area with a waterfall which were clean and comfortable to swim in. They also have a DJ who plays cool jams. I don't plan to stay here again and neither should you. Save yourself from the disappointment and waste of money. Instead, spend a bit more and get a nicer hotel on the strip."
4186,train,1,"Things I love about Hooters: 1. Wings.  2. classy decor, with the signature logo (which is universally known as a sign of sophistication) and the surf-shack meets small town strip club theme. 3. Hooters girls manning the table games and wandering around the place like lost little aerobics instructors - omg, those socks make my heart race. 4. Pool - three pools of differing temperatures, sweet waterfall, and premixed tasty tropical drinks (with admittedly less alcohol than I would like).  5. Rooms - are nice, clean, orange and have comfortable beds. 6. The Dam - A diner with a very educational theme- the Hoover Dam. Hey, it's a big deal, ok. Its an exact replica of a rocky mountain diner experience, complete with cracked-out looking waitresses in ugly gray uniforms serving decadent burgers, and they got you covered for breakfast with a great buffet. But what happened to the frosted flake french toast??? 7. Sense of humor - dont go to vegas without it. While most other hotels try to convince you that simply staying there and spending your money on their casino, overpriced rooms and nightclubs make you a sexy celebrity, Hooters does not front. You know you like scantily clad, cute but not TOO attractive girls serving you onion rings and dealing your blackjack. Hooters has a sense of irony and doesnt take itself too seriously and that makes the Vegas thing more relaxing and enjoyable. 8. Did i say wings? 9. Gift store- bring the old lady home a t shirt and she'll forget about that hooker you accidentally killed during a bachelor party. 10. Dan Marino Steakhouse - need I say more?  things i could live without - dudes at the pool bar whistling every time a girl walks by (even me, so you know they arent even picky), long waits at the Hooters restaurant, room rates have increased significantly for the weekend since last summer. Other than that, its delightfully tacky yet...totally fun."

2459,test,-1,"Four queens used to be the class of downtown.  Now it has degraded to the point of A cross between a Dottys in the ghetto and an over elaborate mc mansion.  The slots are locked down at 89 percent, and despite having a few dealers that are 100 percent on point, fun, chatty, and extremely entreating, the majority of dealers are so cold, and deprived of life that they would fit in like a champ in a Adams Family movie, or even a Godzilla flick.  The mid shift casino manager is a grade A Dick, with a capital D, it's like someone got a soar dick and named it after him.   Carlos, yeah talking to you baby, take a few black chips off his craps table 3 or 4 nights in a row, and he'll kick you off ""his"" table games.  Apparently winners are not allowed here.  The main bonus, and definitely a reason to frequent this place is there are lots of very attentive, cute, and quick cocktail girls.  I would rank them towards the top of the line on Fremont street were the average age of a cocktail girl is pushing 60, the queens has broken through and done something very right with younger, attractive, and pleasant gals.  Very cute outfits, and always smiling, what more could a man ask for, it reason to play in the casino if you can skirt the mean mugging dealers.  Ditch the crappy pit bosses whom have been promoted to the upper limits of there irresponsibility, get some dealers that smile every now and than, kick out the bums that get to ya before security does (need more proactive based security, kick out the bums as soon as they walk in ... Looks like a bum, smells like a bum, GTFO!), and the queens could return to the class of downtown that it once was."

3990,train,1,"I stayed for four days and after just my first day here I was supremely impressed with the staff. From the front desk check-in to the maid service, everything here is top notch.  It is conveniently connected to the Mandalay Bay which provides easy access to the casino and all of its amenities but still has the more intimate feel of a hotel with its separate entrance, bar, restaurants and pool area for guests looking for the option of a slower pace or break from the casino atmosphere. I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it."
8483,train,-1,"For a two day business trip, I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn. I wish I could say that the friendly service offset the shortcomings on the rooms but I cannot.   The bulk of my complaints concern the bathroom. From the ever-running industrial fan to the unfortunately positioned door (flush with the bath tub AND toilet) and the tub plunger that does not plunge (or provide a seal for a bath) I was really, really disappointed with the bathroom. If you're like me, and look forward to hotel bathrooms more than anything else, then you'll definitely want to pass on this hotel.   Another drawback is organization of the rooms in relation to the lobby. There are two major, long wings and my room was at the farthest end of one of those wings. It reminds you of the Shining in that respect...an endless, drab hotel corridor that feels like it'll never stop and when you do arrive it's to a heinous bathroom.  Lastly, the food is very generic and barely a step above plane-quality.   Overall, the hotel has generic, but clean, decor; unfortunate layout; poor food; situated in a business park ; and has annoying bathrooms. There are worse hotels in the universe so I'll give this one two stars but I'd be hard pressed to ever find myself returning."
2426,test,-1,"Very disappointing. I guess they just changed brands; it may have been a Hilton at one point? Or a Crowne? Not sure. In any case, the rooms are tiny, and our group did not get the junior suites as promised. You need a crow-bar to get in and out of the bathroom the way the door is set up. Almost no space to hang clothes, and no drawers. No in-room safe. One of my fellow travelers found a used condom in her room in the trash. The rooms just seemed dirty. The staff couldn't have cared, and was next to useless when trying to arrange for shuttle services. The first morning they told me the shuttle didn't start until noon; it pulled up five minutes later. The next day we called for a pickup at 4pm, and they told me the shuttle was already done for the day. Ridiculous.The restaurant is way overpriced, and the bar/lounge is dark and seedy. The only thing this place has going for it is location. The entire staff needs to be fired."

The food was good. One day I had a Ham and Cheese Omelette which was grea! I actually liked that they placed one of those pre-sliced pieces of cheese over the top of the omelette. Some people probably wouldn't like that, but when you've had a night of drinking, something about that 'fake cheese' (as I like to call it) is sooo good :)  Second time we were there I had the Cobb Salad, omg, fantastic! My husband had a Club Sandwich the first time and it was very good too. The portions they give you are hardy so you're payment won't go to waste. Defiantly give this place a try!  3 stars because there was some food on the ground and we had a sticky table one of the times."
707,train,0,Staff was amazing and the property grounds are first class. My room however was not worth the money. I was in building 17. The camelback view was awesome. The room needed some attention. The bathroom on the surface looked good. But the ceiling grill was detached and hanging. The chrome plate behind the shower was detached. I can't even explain was wrong with the hot water. There was plenty of it but for the first 3-4 minutes of the shower you can't make it cool enough to stand in the stream. Then all of a sudden it gets enough cold water to be able to stand there. The mini bar fridge was broken and the heater was very fickle. It took like 10 min for it to even start giving heat.

The photos here on Yelp make this hotel look really nice.  I'm here to tell you that these photos are in fact deceiving.  Do not be fooled.  That fountain isn't really that beautiful nor romantic when you're actually there in person.  The rooms are dumpy and need major overhauls.      Unfortunately, it comes down to the fact that this hotel is old.  I think the staff is trying to make the best of it, so you can't fault their attitude or service.   Simply put: This hotel needs renovations to bring it back to life.   I've stayed at this hotel on four different occasions due to work.  Due to the obvious concrete structure with cinder-block construction, certain parts of the hotel- like the stairwells - feel like a step above a prison that is trying to have some sort of wannabe resort flair.   With the old age, the rooms stink with body odor and cigarette smoke.  In some rooms the electricity doesn't work.  In all but one of my stays, I had to ask the front desk to fix slow drains in the shower.  Also, I have gotten athlete's foot after each visit -- So be sure to bring flip flops or slippers.  The air conditioners are loud, and the air they blow feels gross because the hotel is old.   I don't understand how other Yelpers have brought this place up to 3.5 stars.  The free breakfast doesn't really negate this slightly depressing hotel property!  If you absolutely have to stay in this area, see if you can get discounts or else just pay up and go across the street to the Kimpton Firesky.   That is actually a resort, with a great property to boot.   I can be snobby about hotels since I've traveled extensively over 15 years... But I'm telling you:  Chaparral Suites is a dump!"

We walked into a foyer filled with noisy, bratty 21yo's clearly there on daddy's trust fund money and strutting around like they own the place (most did not even stay there). Our bags were taken at check-in, and even the staff that checked us in were quite pretentious at this stage. After traveling for half of the day and wanting to make the most of our afternoon and just go out and eat, our bags took over an hour and a half to arrive to our room. We had to call twice to find out where they were. That was day 1.  Day 2 we walked out to the elevator area to see the pool area on fire - although this can't be helped, and was purely accidental, the staff were more interested in watching and taking videos of the fire from our floor than to give us some reassurance that we didn't need to evacuate. Later that day we had to fight through the mass of hotel guests who were expressing their anger about the inconvenience. Most of the staff at this stage were begrudgingly offering discounts etc to the guests who had issues with this. At this time we were asking for minibar charges of over $90 to be removed from our bill because we tried to use the fridge. When I called initially to tell them about this, I was rudely told ""the fridge is not for personal use"" and it was $25 to get the minibar removed.  The worst we experienced was Brad at the Marquee day club, who first refused to accept our travel card because of ""hotel policy"" that had nothing to do with him, and then later did not seem to care when we asked him about WiFi availability for hotel guests, stating ""I don't know, go and ask a bussy"". The moment I was disgusted was when we asked the other hostess to move us (which she did), and shortly after, Brad walked past with two other customers and shook his head, glared in annoyance and pointed at us because we had moved to a shadier spot (it was over 100Â° this day!!).  The only thing that helped this situation was Daniela who checked us out and was the ONLY person in the hotel that we dealt with who cared, showed some compassion and understanding in our frustration and did her job as employed in the SERVICE INDUSTRY to ensure hotel standards were met.  WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT GOOD SERVICE."
7611,train,-1,Spend your hard earn money else where in Vegas  Check- in at 3pm for my large Warp around suite and 1 bed room connecting room. Was told no rooms were open for what i had rented!! ended up waiting for them to track down a room they could offer me till they could fix the problem. took them 5 hours to finally get a room ready for my group.  wasted lost time and money!   while waiting i checked out the Secret pizza- so secret it shouldnt even be open! waited over an hour for a whole pizza! which wasnt great at all! disappointed again... pizza wasnt great at all! under cooked. staff not so friendly   checked out early
7585,train,1,"The chandelier in the middle of the hotel is ridiculously beautiful!  Stunning!  And I'm kind of a hotel snob, so it takes a lot to impress me."
7501,train,1,Very classy hotel and casino. They have excellent restaurants and a pool club. I felt like a VIP the whole time.  Right on the strip in Vegas. Really cool lobby and excellent view from the room.
6085,train,1,"My go to hotel in Vegas on the strip.  It's as busy as any happening strip hotel, but it has great food options, bars around every corner and a great pool scene! It is also home to Marquee, one of the top 3-4 nightclubs in Vegas (and hotel guests get VIP entry for free). If I have one gripe about this hotel it is the gaming, but I give it 5 stars because I am not a huge gambler (love to play craps and their craps setup works just fine for me although they did remove the craps table from the high limit room...). STK is the best steakhouse on the strip (vibe, service, scene and food) and you cannot do any better than The Henry for an omelette. If you are interested in the world's most insane buffet, try the Wicked Spoon. It is simple glutinous!!!"
2763,train,1,"This hotel is swanky!  I love the decor throughout, LOVE the suites, love the restaurants, hate the service.  Service is definitely sub par.  Checking in and out was a pain.  Nothing was done correctly.  Shopping here isn't that great either.  But if the rooms are what matter to you, then stay here!  They're nicer than the suites at Palazzo, Mandalay, H2H, etc."
401,train,1,"First the good: 5 star rooms.  This is a still relatively new resort built in Spanish Mediterranean style.  Rooms are great: big bathrooms, huge walk in showers, standalone big tubs, wireless internet, balconies, nice desks, good beds, large flat screen TVs, and couches.    Also, this is pretty close to the airport - only a $20 ride.  We got great rates on our 2 rooms, about ~$200 per night even though it was spring break week.  Unfortunately, the rest of the resort is lacking.  Lunch was lackluster with disappointingly little choice.  We tried to eat dinner but the restaurants were full even off season - and they weren't sure that we could get room service?!?!?  We then tried to get help from the concierge but the line was so long we gave up.      Pools are nice but on the smaller side.  The family pool seemed packed and the adult only pool, while empty, still had an occasional kid in and out.   Lastly, this resort does not have its own golf course.  As an aside, local gossip reports that the hotel may be having a hard time financially and that Obama stayed here to try to remedy the situation.  So in conclusion, if you're looking for a nice room not far from the airport, this is a good place to come.  If you want a real resort with all the amenities, you may want to think twice."
9373,train,1,"5 stars... (For the price)  Let me start by saying hotel isn't perfect but you get what you pay for.  I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a great pool, hot tub, close to downtown Charlotte, with a restaurant and hopefully room service and free breakfast.  This was the only hotel less than $150 that hit all those boxes, or even most.  Plus the pool is indoor and outdoor.  The cardo and weight room was great.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see out room had been renovated and looked great.  However, parts of the facility are outdated and they are doing construction.  Given the price I paid for the room I felt completely satisfied and would stay here again"
4753,train,1,"My friends and I stayed at the Terrace Suite at Cosmopolitan and it was amazing! It's so spacious and modern, and super comfy. The mattress was oh my goodness comfy and amazing, and so are the couches. I couldn't stop going outside the balcony and chill on the chair outside too. The warm air and Bellagio fountain shows made it super relaxing. Oh, it's super cool you can control lightings from the room phone.   Marquee and restaurants are just an elevator away, so convenient! Also, staffs and bouncers here are nice! I tried couple of those restaurants, and they are all delicious! Even the pizza from Secret Pizza was amazing. Vdara and Aria are also a couple minutes walk away. Would definitely love to stay here again."
4658,train,0,"I stayed at the Hooters Hotel for a weekend and it was around a 100 bucks, i think that's a pretty good price and its pretty close to the strip. I had no complaints, the beds were comfy and bathrooms were clean.. they have their own self service parking garage.. bar located right next to the pool with free towels. They had 3 pools and 2 jacuzzis.it was clean with a nice waterfall..very relaxing and a ton of lounge chairs. I love that the pool was 24 hours! We were there til the early morning..The hotel wasn't bad and I would def. stay here again."
9314,train,1,"My wife and I ended up at a timeshare presentation here. We have been to several, and there is no way we would ever buy one! We have not had a vacation in almost 5 years, and we realized that if we had bought one, we could take at least one nice trip every year. We decided to get one here, and I wasnt sure if it would work the way they all said it would. I have to admit, that we were wrong! My wife and I just got back from Cancun, and it was the best vacation we have ever had. We paid about 15 grand for the timeshare, but our first trip with it would have cost half that amount. Another vacation like that and this does pay for itself ! If you go there, dont worry about the high pressure or marketing bs, because if you want some quality time with your family, this is great!"
7746,train,0,One of the newer Hotels on the Strip . Home to the Marquee Club. Wicked Spoons their in house Buffet is quite good . Hotel seems to have a lot of floor space that is Unfinished .   Pool on the Roof is Nice and Big and boasts a good view of the Strip .   I like the other Hotels that seem to feature more amenities.
3003,train,1,"This was such an AWESOME show. Me & my husband went, while on our honeymoon, he got pulled on stage too, and we enjoyed it so much. They were celebrating their 200th show, I'm so glad we got to experience that with them. The girls had great energy & just looked like they truly enjoy what they are doing. I would definitely recommend this show. We loved it"
9790,train,-1,"Comfort inn is good for location only. We had a nasty odor in our room upon arrival. We went to dinner, hoping it would dissipate. It did not. We alerted staff. They responded quickly to our room concern. Unfortunately, they gave a lame excuse that the maids spritzed something after cleaning the room. ""It should dissipate"". We told him we've been out and have returned and it hasn't dissipated. The hallway smells good. They said they put powder on hallway carpets. So, I guess that means they don't clean the hotel room carpets. No offer to change rooms b/c they are booked for the U2 concert. Very disappointing 2 night stay."
1670,train,1,"I love Cosmopolitan. we got free comps so we stayed here Tuesday till Thursday. the rooms are so spacious and i love how all the rooms have outdoor balconies. we had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show front. our room included a japanese soaking tub which was super relaxing, definitely a great room if you're with your lover/husband/significant other. Theres convenient parking in the garage that is close to the hotel elevators near the East wing of the parking structure. The only negative I would say about the room is that there is no refrigerator, or at least not in the suite we were staying at, only a minibar. I would stay here all the time, but only if we got comps. Otherwise, at $300/night its way out of my budget. :T"
9355,train,1,"First let me start by saying I'm not a local, and I am reviewing this ""cabane a sucre"" (sugar shack) from an American's point of view.  My family really wanted to see a sugar shack while vacationing in Montreal in March.  I looked at lots of sugar shacks online, but it was the guy who rented us his VRBO apartment who suggested Constantin's.  We were VERY happy with our experience here!  The horse drawn carriage ride was simple, but it was really cool being able to see the trees tapped, drawing out the maple sap.  The little petting zoo was probably one of the best we've ever been to, with lots of well-taken-care-of animals in a small, but clean and bright indoor area.  The dinner was a traditional ""cabane a sucre"" one, served family style, with unlimited refills.  There was bread, pate and several jars of pickled vegetables on the table when we were seated.  Then came bean soup, followed by cole slaw, a fluffy omelet with sliced ham and delicious pork rinds on top, boiled potatoes, small sausages, and beans (""pork and beans"" style).  Dessert was a choice of sugar pie with ice cream (yummy!) or some other cake (which we did not try).  Of course, there was a large carafe of maple syrup on the table, which was much tastier and less sweet than the cheapie American kind.  This may sound like a strange menu to outsiders, but it is the traditional meal served at sugar shacks - just go with it, it was actually quite good.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, and the locals sitting next to us were quite friendly as well.  After dinner, even though you are stuffed, you can go to the ice house to sample as much frozen maple toffee on a stick as you want.  The ice tender pours fresh syrup on the ice, you wait 15 seconds to let it get cold, then use a popsicle stick to wind it up into a small lollipop.  The toffee is very sweet with a mild maple flavor, not like the strong (and probably artificial) maple taste Americans are used to.  You can then wander outside and huddle around the festive outdoor fire, enjoying the cold air.  There were other activities that we did not participate in, like a puppet show (held throughout tha day, ending around 4:30pm, I think) and a disco on Friday and Saturday nights, which are probably very nice as well.  All in all, we had a great, festive time, and I would certainly recommend Constantin's to anyone looking to experience a fun piece of Canada's heritage."
8121,train,1,So bright and shiny!  You have arm room to move around compared to other casino.  I loved this for all the beads and mirrors.  I found the hangover game too what a plus!
5548,test,0,"I stayed at Hooters Casino & Hotel for NYE 2013 with a small group of friends and we shared a room with two double beds.   We paid about $350 for three nights starting with New Years Eve and this was a great deal considering I wanted to be near The Strip but refused to pay top-dollar prices. Conveniently, Hooters is located across the street from MGM which is in fact on The Strip - so there you go! If it had not been so damned cold we would have walked everywhere - but considering most mornings/nights dropped to around 30F we ended up driving more than expected.   I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel room and casino quality (considering the price point) and would gladly return here again for a cheap room in the off-season. I've read in other reviews that their rooms are usually $30 a night and that is a great deal.    Our room was on the 7th floor and had 2 double beds, a great view of their pool, free wi-fi and some cable TV channels (for the record - watching Law & Order SVU when drunk in Las Vegas is extra disturbing). Room service is available if so inclined.   The CONS in terms of the hotel room: Bathtub had an issue with draining properly and you'd end up standing in the soapy water after a few mins. The beds were a bit springy. No mini-fridge.  The casino was a step above anything you'd see on Freemont - not fancy but not run down either. The bar served $4 draft beer which was quite nice. They also have those famous hot wings and a cheap prime rib dinner. I didnt eat here but my partners in crime enjoyed a breakfast of steak & eggs and a brk burrito with good reviews.   Overall, three star quality hotel but five star value."
3928,train,1,"Attention my Yelp followers and friends, I have found nirvana! Well at least in terms of hotels in Las Vegas. The Four Seasons LV is quite possibly the closest thing to my version of heaven.  From the moment you enter the lobby doors, you know you are about to experience true luxury. Fresh flowers are in every corner, beautiful furniture and tile adorn the registration area, the place smells amazing, they call me Miss C., they hand you ice cold bottled water after you have endured the 103 degree weather outside...they treat you like royalty.  Then you get to your room...  The lights are dimmed, the bed has been turned down, the curtains are drawn to allow a glimpse of your 36th floor view of the strip, there are delicious truffles and sweets placed next to the bed with another cold bottle of water, there are L'Occitane body products in the bathroom and the TV is set to a scene of a babbling brook to soothe your tired traveling soul. You feel relaxed, calm...even sexy if you will. The bed will be the most amazing thing you have ever slept in...literally to the point where you inquire where to buy one for your home.  Once you get cleaned up and dressed for the night, all you need to do is have the door man hail you a taxi to your casino of choice, or simply enter the private door directly into the Mandalay Bay. Amazing restaurants, nightclubs and gambling are within walking distance, yet you still have the serenity of your private entrance back to your room.  And that's not all...  The Four Seasons offers a private pool with a gate to the wild and crazy Mandalay Bay Beach. Go get the party out of your system if you want, but I recommend sticking to their quieter option. Allow the cabana boys to prepare your chaise lounge with fresh towels and a pitcher of iced water with lemon. Need your sunglasses cleaned while you take a dip? They will take care of you. How about a chilled towel to cool off your face while they serve you complimentary frozen melon and spritz you with Evian.  No joke my friends...it's worth every penny. I think I'm in love, if possible, with a hotel. Until I return, I will savor the memories of their terry cloth robes and get a brief fix from the toiletries I took from the maid cart."
2582,train,0,"I've stayed here a few times but not since it was a Hilton, so I'm not sure how much this hotel might have changed since then. Therefore, I'll try to stick with generalities and local impressions.  The location of this hotel is perfect if you're in town for a Steelers/Panthers or Pirates game. Heinz Field is about a 20 minute walk across the bridge, PNC Park, maybe about half that. Point State Park is on the way to Heinz Field and practically right in the hotel's front yard.  There are not many restaurants or bars nearby and downtown can be fairly dead on weekends anyhow, but there are (or were) some pretty decent onsite options including a sports bar. Room service was available and was decent.  The rooms were O.K. and if you were lucky enough the get a room that faced the river, you had a fantastic view. On one visit, however, I had to change rooms within an hour of checking in because there was just too much noise coming from next door. However, I wouldn't blame the hotel for that and my other stays at the old Hilton were nice and quiet.  Definitely the place to stay if you're going to be attending any sporting events downtown. Pricy, but the location makes it worthwhile."
113,train,1,"This is a lovely hotel that my colleague and I stay at whenever in town for work. I would say the hotel itself is a 4 star, but the people that work there are fabulous and push this up to a 5 for me.  Today I had to pull some room statements from a few months ago, and Patrick was incredible. Very professional while juggling my call and guests checking in, patient and with a great sense of humor to top it off."
8141,train,1,"Still an awesome place to hang out and people watch, especially on Friday and Saturday nights once it gets lively. Best casino gaming drinks anywhere in Vegas, just tip your waitress early and often and you will get premium drinks and liquors, as well as specialty house cocktails just for asking. Me and a buddy played (5+ hours!) on the megabucks progressive dollar slot machine situated by Bond and The Henry restaurant on a late Friday night and enjoyed all the scenery and incredible drink service and drinks. The best part is we both only put in $100 each and literally played a spin maybe every 5-10 minutes and was able to keep playing and playing, and drinking and drinking. Best $150 you can spend inside a casino for 5 to 6 hours and enjoy a nice continual adult beverage. Plus we had that minuscule chance of winning big too..."
1317,test,1,"The quality of this hotel far exceeded my expectations.  We stayed here because of the low price and really weren't expecting much.  The rooms are newly remodeled and very modern.  They include a kitchen with all of the amenities you need (toaster, fridge, stovetop, dishwasher w/detergent, dishes, etc..).  They have a little pantry where you can buys supplies and the prices are very reasonable ($1 for Greek yogurt).  Free coffee/tea in the lobby 24 hours and free laundry as well.  There is also a nice running trail our back, which makes up for the out dated fitness room.  I'd stay here again, especially if it was for a long trip."
9791,train,-1,"Everything was very old except for the flat screen tv, but it had poor cable reception.  There is only one computer at the business center that you have to pay to use and to print. There was a free option to print your boarding pass but it didn't work. Limited parking that is not free and sometimes park in the basement and walk up through the ramp.   The bathroom has no tub, just a shower.  The good things are its location, adequate space in the room, tabletop power outlets for your electronics.   It was clean except for the ice from the machine that came out dirty."
8791,train,-1,"I wish I saw all of these bad reviews of this hotel before booking my room. My family and I stayed here last night to get some rest after our drive from Texas. Welp we didn't get that much rest at all. First off, the trash cans were overflowing and we couldn't throw anything away. That night, I took a shower and already noticed a hair in my shower that wasn't mine. There was also some dirty foreign stains on the bottom of the tub. The room was pretty warm at night but it was bearable at the time. Around midnight the air conditioner stopped working. My dad went up to the lobby to get a new room, which we did end up getting. In the new room, I noticed on my bed two dead bugs (not bed bugs) and was pretty disgusted. I had to lay my own blanket on top of the bed in order to fall asleep. Also, the bathtub in the new room was leaking and had rust on the bottom of it. The next morning, I found a big bite on my foot that I did not have before my stay at this hotel. The ice machine doesn't work. During checkout the lady did mention the new ownership transition that is happening right now. I gave this hotel one star only due to the service that we received regarding the room switch. Until this place changes for the better, my family and I will never be staying at this hotel ever again."
2584,train,-1,"This hotel has a great location and awesome views but that is it.  It is filthy and needs a major overhaul as far as cleaning and upkeep is concerned.  Hallways and elevators were disgusting, dust everywhere throughout the hotel and in the guest rooms, cobwebs and dust caked on fixtures in the 3 rivers restaurant above the omelet station, just overall unclean and in poor repair (wallpaper peeling off in places, ceiling peeling in places, trash was underneath my bed from the previous guest, etc; a colleague found glass in the sheets of her bed, several others said they changed rooms because their room was so dirty......I think it's a good value and location but would not stay here by choice."
6249,train,1,"I booked a two bedroom suite and ended up getting two condos that were connected.  Check in through the VIP room was easy and attentive.  Again, it was not a true two bedroom unit but two units connected. One was much larger and functioned as a master bedroom.  Both units were suites and large for a single hotel unit.  Both units had high end appliances including refrigerators. The view was fantastic. The gym is above average but has free weights (dumbells to 100 lbs).  The gym as interesting ligthting that makes you look more ""cut"".   Bench press is a smith machine (I could not find a barbell bench press on the strip) We were visiting Vegas for my girl's USTA national tennis tournament and the onsite tennis courts (2) became useful for warm up.  Overall nice hotel but ingress and egress is suboptimal.  They do a fantastic job on moving the traffic from the tight space but feels very claustrophobic"
7340,train,1,"Beautiful interior as far as the famous chandeliers go, I just wish they would've stuck with the theme and not have random pieces of art in the hallway that has no correlation with the main theme that the Cosmo is known for. Service at the front desk in my situation was annoying. The man who checked us in had 0 to little eye contact which I find rude, he was annoyed with our questions & was rushing us. I'm sure not every employee is like this, however this fellow was. The room we have is a standard 2 queen bedroom with nice balcony & beautiful restroom . The elevator makes me nauseous. But on the bright side, it's convenient to all of the stores we've been too and the spa as well. Easy access to the strip, right smack dab in the middle. This hotel has a lot of things to keep busy, so you really won't have to leave. Restaurants, ice cream, shops, gambling, spa, pool, etc ! There's so much to do ! & yes I would return :)"
8816,train,1,"This is a great comfort inn. There is a shuttle which will take you to MGM and Planet Hollywood, The Wynn and Convention Ctr and pick up drop off at the airport. The bed in the room OH MY it was incredibly soft. Definitely Join the Choice Privileges program and prepay for your stay the rate is really cheap. The room is a kitchenette. And comes with a coffee maker and microwave mini fridge. The Bathroom has a Iron and Ironing board. From Check in to Check out the hotel staff was amazing.   I looked into the pool area and its clean with ample chairs for laying out. Security is roving around the lot at night so your vehicles are safe as well. I recommend this place if your attending a venue at the hard rock, and even if the shuttle isnt running, its a short walk up Harmon to the Strip. I never seen a roach in the room and i did see 2 ants but that will not deter me from staying there."
2298,train,0,"It's ok for what it is. 24 hour pool, cheap rooms, and pretty much just barley off the strip. It's close to tropicana, Luxor, Excalibur, and mandalay bay. They really hook up the comp drinks above and beyond the strip casinos if you're playing video poker at the bar. Sometimes check in takes a while, and the rooms aren't super nice, but you get what you pay for."
1204,train,0,"I've stayed in worse. This is definitely the most convenient hotel for Lake Mead as it's a 5 minute drive down to the lake. There's also a pretty cool hiking trail right behind the hotel that takes you next to the lake for some pretty awesome views.  The staff wasn't very friendly. They all seemed like they hate their jobs (I don't really blame them, the hotel is in the middle of nowhere) But no one was extremely rude. The food at Cafe Kokopelli was OK, not horrific but not amazing either. The hostess was a little snot though and I could have gone without her attitude.  The room was small and tolerable. The carpet was kind of stained which was a little gross, but it was a pet friendly room. We were able to rent a mini fridge for $10/night for our perishables which was pretty cool.  Best part was that they allowed all 3 of our dogs for $10 each (not even per night!)  It's also less than 1/4 mile from the Hoover Dam, although we didn't get a chance to check that out.  The casino is kind of boring...all just the same slots. Not too much variety. And the machines don't take coins so that's a pain in the behind.  Took advantage of the 99cent breakfast after midnight, which was an awesome deal.  Overall it was OK for our first trip to the lake.  Next time we'll probably just stay in Henderson and make the drive for some more homey accomodations."
1127,train,1,"I stayed here last week for work.    Overall I had a great experience.  The service was friendly and helpful.  My room rocked.  I had a walk out patio with a few chairs and table that overlooked the golf course.  It had an awesome living room with couch, chair, desk, etc.  The bedroom was roomy with an awesome bathroom - double sinks, big tub and a separate glass shower.  Since I was there for a work meeting there was the requisite meeting room, breakfast room, cocktail hour, etc.  Everything was great.  We had lunch set up outside one day which was gorgeous.  I would definitely stay here when back in Scottsdale area!"
1528,test,1,"This review is only for the hotel.  A friend stayed here last year for the WSOP for three weeks.  He got a great deal on the room and best of all - it was actually nice.  I remembered being a little amazed when I walked into the suite, I thought it would be all old and Granny style.  He got upgraded to a suite, and it was freshly renovated, had new furniture and a 37"" flat screen, Ballin Strip style, no historical artifacts in sight.  It worked out great for him as a ""base of operations"" during his extended poker jaunt.  I would do what you can to get a suite though, I don't think the regular rooms are as nice.  A suite here should cost you one half to one third what the Venetian is asking.  Also if you were set on gambling downtown I think the Golden Nugget and Binions are more fun.  Stay here, gamble there."
6740,train,1,Rooms are nice and spacey. Great pool area and service close to most locations by foot. The check in took very long but we were there on the fourth of July.
6674,test,1,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in. When you enter the lobby its like a friggn acid trip. The pillars have moving pictures in them, I couldn't stop staring because their are like naked people images pressing against the screen, it was unbelievable! True art and very futuristic. The rooms are so pretty and the parking is easy. No problem with cell phones and our iPads, like other hotels. The room we had was quiet and relaxing with a deep bathtub that I had the pleasure of using this morning. We've stayed at a lot of hotels and this definetly one of my faves! My husband just informed me we have an upgraded room, lucky me!"
6130,train,0,The hotel is very glitzy.  Was disappointed with the room because I thought it would be just as impressive as the initial walk through the casino was.  The beds are super comfy!  Hung out at the bamboo pool all day this past Saturday.  The food was pretty good.  Don't get the shrimp cocktail!  They only give you three shrimps =/.  I got to try the cuban sandwich.  So delish!  Ordering the drinks at the bar was such a pain.  The bartender was really slow and didn't put enough tequila in my overpriced margarita  :(  Never went back to order from the bar again and ordered drinks from our server.  The grape escape was pretty good.    The club at the hotel was pretty fun.  I liked how we didn't have to leave the hotel to party...
7483,train,1,I come here like every other month for a mini vacation its like my home away from home!

Ill actually be back in about a month :D
3348,train,-1,"Do not stay here - and 1000% DO NOT even begin to consider using this location for anything related to an even that might be even marginally important.   We reserved an entire block of rooms as well as the shuttle service for a wedding a mile and a half away from the hotel. We confirmed everything multiple times over several months, most recently this afternoon. An hour before the wedding they refused to take anyone. The driver claimed she didn't drive to the neighborhood even though it was well within the radius that she said she would deliver within (under three miles).  We had to reserve last minute shuttles for the groom and bridal party (paying additional money) while guests were left to fend for themselves. All of this is happening while it's raining, by the way.   On top of this, the manager refused to speak to anyone on the phone (waited for over 20 minutes to do so).   The entire reason for choosing this hotel was for the proximity and the shuttle service - it certainly wasn't for the corporate ambiance, the price, or the laughable customer service.   If I could rate less than one star, I absolutely would."

3139,train,1,So we stayed here to ring in the new year.  Part of the reason we chose The Four Seasons was because we wanted a lower key new years.  Upon our check out we informed the manager about our stay as there was a problem with the vents. The hotel manager Doug followed up with us and did everything to make it right.  We returned this month where Doug reserved a strip view room as well as checking up on us every so often and including complementary items to ensure our stay was perfect. They more than made up for the problem we had on our first visit! We will go back again.
7143,train,1,"This casino/hotel is CLASSY. It just feels nice to be in, whether you're on the casino floor or upstairs wandering around the shops. There are lots of chandeliers everywhere. There are a ton of dining options here as well. Henry's is on the first floor (near one of the entrances) for casual American dining. There's also a bar next to it, and there's even a display case where I saw a woman dancing in the display case one evening.  Upstairs there's a swanky nightclub, and some cool shops and restaurants. I ate at China Poblano (don't recommend... see my review) but there's also Holstein's Burgers and Shakes next door that looks promising. There's even an All Saints store, a Rent the Runway shop, and a kidrobot shop upstairs, and how many casinos can claim these stores!?  Wicked Spoon buffet is also here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but know there's a buffet option here.  There's also an easy to access walkway to the pedestrian bridge, so you can easily go to the Aria or Crystal Shoppes or go across the street to Miracle Mile."
4599,train,-1,"I'd say this place is a notch above the ghetto fabulousness of Circus Circus, but at least they have some incredibly fun, albeit cheesy, games to keep you entertained. All this place has got are some plain Jane girls in orange leggings and a Dan Marino Grill. The much-promoted $3 blackjack table is literally ONE table on the floor. Unsurprisingly, it's also the most crowded spot in the joint, so good luck pulling up a seat. I sat at the video poker machines and dropped $70 in about 20 min and the goddamn waitress didn't come by once to keep my blood alcohol level high enough to not start getting pissy about my losses. That fact alone will keep me out of here for a long time.   One marginal positive note is that they have $0.25 wings from 12am-6am, although if you've ever eaten wings from Hooters you know that means you'll probably spend only a couple bucks to get high cholesterol, the caloric equivalent of 5 Whoppers and a long bout of diarrhea. If you call that a deal, well... have at it."
1549,train,-1,Currently staying at the hotel. It is not the easiest in the eyes but it does the job. Gambling wise I personally am not a fan and would definitely rather go to the cal or Fremont to gamble.  The rooms itself are okay. The beds are firmer so if you like soft beds don't come here. I personally kinda like it. Easier in the back. The bathrooms are kinda gross.  Its an okay place to stay if youre trying to get the downtown Vegas feel without paying much. I'd rather stay at the cal or main street though.
8606,train,1,"It seemed we drove forever to get to the hotel from the freeway, it's about five miles away from the strip. We finally saw it from a distance and it was huge As soon as we pulled up front we were greeted by Valet and he took care of us rather fast and was very friendly, he called for a bell boy who took all of our luggage.  My girlfriend and I went to check in and there was no wait, the gentlemen who checked us in did just that but nothing further. I asked him for tips on what to do in the hotel, he didn't seem to have a good connection or experience to give me advice. I also asked what was good to eat in the hotel since we were super hungry, his suggestion seemed as he just read a Boucher and repeated what it said.  The walk from the front desk is a good distance from the hotel, but that was okay as we were able to walk by the restaurants, and see a bit of the casino.  Okay Yelpers, the reviews are not all good on here, and I was SUPER worried what we got into, the appearance seemed clean, but we knew it was a 50/50... As we walked in, it was a HUGE RELIEF the room was SUPER nice, and Very Clean. No problems with smoke at all. The bed was also very comfy.  The next morning we wanted to check out the buffet as we walked up the line was too long for me.  We kept walking, and right next door was a little restaurant. We got seated pretty fast, and the waitress came rather fast and offered us the specials. The food was great, and the waitress was also great. The casino is a good size and had a lot of slot play. They do have a rewards card that gets you some advantages. We went to the desk, and there was no line and three people working. The lady we went up to seemed as we interrupted her conversation with the other ladies behind the desk. She seemed as she did not want to help us and our questions were just an interruption to her day.  Our check out was easy, and fast. The lady who checked us out was very nice. Over all I would highly recommend this place if you don't mind being away from the strip. I am very picky and if it was going to be sketchy or dirty to us we would have left. I was very VERY surprised on how clean and updated everything seemed to be. If management reads this, the way you are teaching your valet team, and bell boys to conversant and give a good reputation for customer service I would suggest to do the same with the front desk, and rewards card desk.  Usually customer service would drag my stars down, however we did run into a few very helpful people. The prices from a third party booking agency online got us a GREAT DEAL. There is a resort fee just keep that in mind."
8323,train,-1,"Beyond incompetent, horrible, unprofessional concierges. It took an hour just to check into the hotel. Then when I was checking out, they added someone else's $300 restaurant bill onto my room charge, and they refused to take it off until THEY could figure out who actually ate at the restaurant (still a pending charge after I already checked out of the hotel). They also added a $500 credit card hold by mistake because the guy ""typed in the wrong code"".  I was excited about the hotel. It's brand new, the rooms are very clean and nice, and it's practically on the strip. It is quite small though; way smaller than the photos on the internet. Only 8-9 floors. Don't come here until they get new staff or train them."
3862,train,1,"Very chic hotel with a cool chandelier bar! It's right across the street from the shopping mall (planet hollywood) and next to Bellagio, so the location is great!  We stayed here 2 nights for the Bruno Mars concert that we in the theater and loved it! Tons of casual and fancy restaurants to choose from too!  China Poblano was one of our favs that was casual and oh so delicious!"
541,train,1,Booked the night tour while my friend from St Louis was visiting Susan and Judy were great.  Learned a lot about the properties. Living in Las Vegas it was nice to see the sights and NOT be the one driving down the strip.  Lol.
7377,train,1,"My best friend and I just spent this past weekend at The Cosmopolitan for the first time. We had the 1200 Square foot wrap around terrace suite and it was beyond beautiful. We by far had the best view of the strip, especially at night. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL, the casino was immaculate! It's very pricey but so worth it if you can afford it. We had an unforgettable time."
9227,train,1,This place was great during our stay. They offered free buffet style breakfast. We got the suite. It was spacious with a balcony. This place uses a key to unlock/lock the door. We also got a welcome pack. I like how they offered slippers in the room. They provided toothbrush and toothpaste when requested. The pool is great for kids. The rooftop contains the jacuzzi and a decent view. There are a lot of restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommend this place.
6479,train,-1,"They are the worst, I made my reservation over a month ago they told me I would have 2 queen beds bc I have 3 people in the room but when I got here it only had a queen and they wanted me to pay more to up grade when I did not get what I asked for in the first place!"
5892,train,1,Just spent four nights here and had a great time. The staff was amazing. We got our room upgraded and it was very nice. Would definitely spend another vacation here.
5082,train,-1,"One star purely because they advertised ""$3 blackjack 24/7,"" but only had ONE table going.  Great."
3253,train,-1,"It is clear this place is being run by bankers...it's being run on the cheap due to bankruptcy I think.  They cut corners everywhere, not cleaning the rooms properly or providing the little things (shampoo) unless you ask.  The rooms are kinda dirty, the pools are murky.  For example, there was dried puke on the wall by our toilet...gross!  The elevators are way too hot and slow.  The nightclub is so loud that you can hear it all night (till 4am) even with earplugs in.  Don't stay here unless all you care about is partying."
2716,test,1,"We were in a junior suite for a girls weekend.   Room and cost were awesome.   Staff gave exceptional service.   Hotel was In the heart of everything.  Only downer was the slow room service, due to the hotel being so full.   Also people next door were loud!  No sound proof walls here.   But hey it's VEGAS!!!!!   Sleep when you get home!"
9310,test,1,"I was VERY skeptical of The Jockey Club.  I was flying into Las Vegas for the wedding during the same weekend as EDC.  I was prepared to spend $$$$.  Every hotel on the strip was charging $250+ per night but I came across a listing for The Jockey Club through VRBO for only $80/night.  I struck gold!  The reservation process seems sketchy-- every unit is owned privately so your experience may vary.  This review is for room 694 through Suite Vacations Inc.  I had a few messages back and forth with the unit owner and had to paypal funds on a leap of faith.  Lucky for me they are completely legit.  The reservation was independently confirmed with the security manager at The Jockey Club so I had peace of mind.    This timeshare is CONNECTED to The Cosmopolitan with access to their Bamboo Pool.  They also have their own pool and their own gym (w/ a water cooler).  A free shuttle to supermarkets, vending machines, etc.  Very very convenient.  The common areas are a bit dingy but I found my unit to be extremely clean.  The unit is HUGE.  I'm talking a 1 bedroom with a walk in closet, a living room w/ a sofa bed, a full kitchen with a stove, fridge, sink, an island with stools and a dining table set.  Free wifi.  $80/night.  I kid you not.    I don't think I can ever justify staying anywhere else on the strip.  Every morning I wake up in Vegas,  I can use the money I saved and bet $170 on black.  or red.  or double zero.  It doesn't matter because a penny saved is a penny I can throw around however I like in Sin City."
4453,train,1,Beautiful hotel with great views of the city. I wouldn't recommend it for a vacation with the kids. Pool access on the roof is connected to a very upscale restaurant which was awkward walking past in your swimsuit.
9770,train,1,"The lobby of this hotel is nice and has a seating area with a fireplace.  The people working the front desk are friendly and helpful.  There are 3 elevators and I usually never have to wait long for one to appear (so fast!).  There's a convenient store (24 hour Pavilion Pantry) located in the hotel where you can find things you might have forgotten to pack.  The rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom has a lot of counter space and cubby holes to hold your toiletries.  They are equipped with a microwave and refrigerator, which is a nice bonus.  Their beds are similar to sleep by number where you can adjust the firmness/softness with a dial.  There's free wifi at the hotel (lobby and in room) and also a free internet cable connection in the room if you want to go old school.  Some nights, the internet slows to a crawl, though...feels like dial up if you know what that is.  The one thing I wish they offer is a robe in the room.  Sometimes it gets chilly but I don't want to turn up the heat right before going to sleep.  NOTE for January 2013: There is construction going on kitty corner from the hotel on Dundas, and you may hear it starting at 7am if you are in a room on the street side.  This hotel has 7 floors with 147 rooms.  There is a free shuttle service anywhere within 3km/1mile between 7a-10a.  You can sign up at the front desk.  The van seats about 6 people and leaves every half hour on the hour.  There's a complimentary business center in the lobby, including printer and copier.  LOCATION:  This hotel is located on the corner of Jarvis and Dundas.  The location of this Hilton is not the closet to the trains, but walkable.  It's about a 15 minute walk to the Eaton Center and you can cut across the big parking lot on Shuter that's between Mutual St and Dalhousie St to get to Queen.  There is another Hilton Garden Inn that is closer to the Eaton Center that's located on 92 Peter Street (this is the Downtown one).  There's a Tim Hortons and Pi-Tom Thai restaurant right across the street.  COST: Corporate rate averages about $140-150/night.  Regular rates averages about $170 - 190.  NEAR BY:  There are a few restaurants near by that  you can grab a quick bite.  Right next door is Casey's Bar and Grill where you can grab a beer or a bite to eat.  Across the street is a Tim Horton's and Pi-Tom Thai restaurant."
2048,train,1,My husband and I spent one night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas. The staff was impeccable and courteous. When we arrived to our suite we noticed the smell of smoke in the front bathroom. I called the front desk and within five minutes we were moved to another suite. The suite was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Over all all our expectations were met. I would recommend this hotel (separate from casino but with access to Mandalay Bay).
5273,train,-1,"Chelsea ballroom for Super Bowl Party !  Never again!!!!  How is it that everyone that got tickets to attend the Super Bowl Party at the Chelsea ballroom and about 100 people left standing.  There were not enough tables and chairs for the guests. It was ridiculous!!  It was so unorganized!!    I had to put two chairs together side by side and three of us sit together, of course the other end girl and myself get to share it with only half of our cheeks.  My husband had to stand during the 1st half of the game.  The other guy went back up to the room and watch the game, my bro in law went out to game at a table, one girl went up to the room and took a nap.  Thats how 7 of us got seating at the end.  And we snatched from other tables too.  Pathetic.!!  The food selection was very minimal!!  One small circle and that's it.  No pizza, shrimp cocktails, Haagen dazs ice cream, buffalo wings ran out, No vegetarian food for veggie friend. I could go on... but I'm tired.   I guess we were spoiled by Caesers Palace Super Bowl.    Good Game though.  I'm a Denver fan so I didn't really care who wins.  Although we cheered on Baltimore because half of our friends put their bet on Ravens 1st half and 49ers 2nd half."
9431,train,1,"Stayed here a while back.  Let me start by saying, I have stayed, at the Mandalay Bay, the Mansions at the MGM, so on and so on, I think you get the point.  The hotel is located off the main area of most hotels in LV, it reminders me of what LV was back in the day.   We were invited to see BJ Thomas here by our sweet wonderful neighbors, so we thought, why not. I am just going to jump right in....  In no particular order here -  BJ can sign like no other, even being I've never really heard his music, well that's not true, when he started signing I've heard some of those songs being that my mom would play his music loudly on the car radio, back in the day, but frankly, the room where the concerts was held in the hotel was fab!!!  It was such a nice venue within the hotel, the size of the room made it so everyone had a great seat.  '1' point so far!   Secondly, the lobby is neat and clean, check-in was a plus and the service was warm and friendly - so now there are '2' points).    While waiting for our friends, we decided to eat at the Mexican cafÃ© or restaurant - it's has patio seating (there are different salsa's to choose from), O  M  G, best salsa ever!!! And the Margaretta was AMAZING! Who new! Would definitely go there again, hands down.  So there you have it, we are already up to '3' points (on the scale of 1 to 5, 5 being best).    Off to our room....... Now here is the real test.  But let's be honestly, when most are in LV, it's for the shows, gambling, food and pools.  Yes, we want a clean room, but very little time is spent there - well for most anyway (insert wink).  Open the door to our room, and what a surprise.  Clean (bathroom was clean), neat (everything had its place), nothing overly fancy, yet the rooms were updated,  and the bed was actually comfortable...and that was good for us.  Honestly, I  was actually surprised.  I didn't know what to think before goin.  But all in all it was nice! The whole hotel is clean.  So now we are up to '4' points.    We had dinner that night at ""The Broiler"" in the hotel.  This place is a hidden gem, the food was Franfrickentastic! The Steaks was so good,  that truly it was just as good if not better than any Ruth Chris, Morton's I've been too.  I highly recommend, going out of your way, just to have dinner here, I was shocked I tell ya, my dinner was delicious!!! Kudo to whoever is the chef! Drum Roll - Dinner that evening, putting the hotel into the 5 star category.    And that my YELPER friends, is why I gave this hotel '5' stars.  They earned it!    Thank you Boulder, we had a blast, and will be back!"
281,train,1,"I've stayed in a few hotels in Edinburgh now & I think Mercure has got to be up there. We managed to get a pretty good deal on a Double room for one night staying Fri-Sat. I wouldn't have thought a hotel so central AND this nice would offer such great deals (we paid about Â£60) but if you can book in advance then do check here.   Situated right above the M&S on Princes Street this hotel was super handy for getting around Edinburgh. We've never stayed in a hotel SO central/near Princes Street before so it was a surprise when we realised where it was!   There's a bit of a trek up some winding stairs to get to the reception area but there is a ramp and lifts also. Checking in was pretty straight forward; we were given our room key card which then activated the lifts to the floors above. We were on the 7th floor (I think?!) and also (by chance/fluke?) we had a room with a castle view! Brilliant. I was worried being situated at the front of the hotel, on Princes St of the noise factor (I'm quite a light sleeper) but I have to say I hardly heard a thing. The actual hotel was really quiet (no noise from the rooms next to us or lobby) and the windows do a great job of blocking out the below street/people noise. The temperature in the room was a tad warm for me when we arrived but the radiators were easy enough to adjust to your comfort level.   We had a huge Super King sized bed which was actually really comfortable (for a hotel!) and I slept like a baby. I don't think I've slept that well in a hotel for ages...There was plenty of wardrobe space & hangers for clothes, the bathroom was a really good size (bigger than your average hotel), there was a table with chair & an armchair also, tea & coffee facilities in the room (hidden in a drawer) and the TV was a decent size too. I also really liked that we didn't have to Check Out until 12pm ~ this is music to my ears being a great lover of a long lie-in :-) Only issue we had was the Wi-Fi was a bit sketchy...dropping connection every now & then, but aside from that no complaints here.  I can't comment on the food or restaurant as we didn't eat in. The staff were all very pleasant & helpful. All in all a top night/stay was had!"
4823,train,-1,"So my husband and I were staying at the hotel across the street and got craving for some chicken wings so naturally we headed to Hooters.  Once you walk in you can feel the sadness of this hotel. It looks absolutely ran down and just about ready to close its doors..  We came to the restaurant and set at the bar thinking we just want a quick bite and move on with our plans. Once we sat at the bar we noticed that the bartenders were fighting and yelling at each other about something and needless to say, completely ignored us... Another waitress walked into the bar and we tried to get her attention so we can order, she rudely yelled at us that she doesn't work behind this bar and walked away. Meanwhile, still to acknowledgment from the other bartenders. We lost our patients and got a manager that apologized profusely and comped everything besides the wings.  The wings were delicious but the place and service left a sour taste in our mouths..  Probably will not come back there again. Shame.."
5711,train,1,"Amazing experience.  Came for my 10 year anniversary and it was pure luxury.  Great customer service, quick check in time.  We ate at three of the onsite restaurants and every meal was spectacular.  I would definitely upgrade for the wrap around terrace suite. Make sure you ask for the side that faces the Bellagio!  The location is perfect on the strip and right next to Ceasars.  The bamboo pool is super relaxing...you HAVE to try to spicy corn salad.  I ordered it for lunch 3 days in a row!"
6393,train,1,"Love this hotel  But don't like that in the Buffett  restaurant they don't respect handy cup , the lady in the line   Was very rode !!!!!!!"
8248,train,1,"After a few days i must say i love this place. Staff is great, food awesome, hot clubs w free entry if your a guest!!! Yay! Room is spectacular with views. Location is awesome. Beautiful people all over. Reminds me of fountainbleu in miami with a nicer, caring staff. I will stay here again!!! You guys rock! I also stay at Ritz and 4 seasons. Not a family place but a high class party place!"
7368,train,1,"When I come to Vegas for work, the Four Seasons is my home away from home... but when I come to Vegas for play, Cosmo is my one and only. This hotel has everything you could ask for for a party weekend- a central location on the Strip, gorgeous decor, beautiful people, great nightclubs (especially Rose.Rabbit.Lie), top restaurants, even the Rent the Runway store in case you need to elevate your outfit for the evening. The fantastic customer service and the little touches in the rooms really propel this hotel into luxury status, and the prices are quite affordable given that almost every window has a gorgeous view of the Bellagio Fountain."
5721,train,-1,"Okay, I don't understand why everyone is giving this hotel so many stars.  (I find it funny some of the reviewers actually work there LOL)  I went for the first time this weekend to see Damain Marley and Nas in concert.  Now, JUST pulling in to the hotel was already a bad experience.  I am pretty sure that the guys who designed this place (both inside and out) were on acid when they did it, and just scribbled on some paper.  It was worse than trying to figure out a labyrinth.    I valet a lot, and even before I had ever been to the Cosmo, I was warned by a couple of different friends that the valets have a tendency to steal.  One friend actually had his iPod Touch stolen out of his arm rest, and they refused to do anything to replace it.  Anyway.  I pull in to valet to see ""Valet Full.""  Okay, that's weird for a new, hip, hotel but it happens.  My boyfriend rolls down the window to ask about self parking, and hears a worker tell another patron say, ""No, it's not full.  There is just no valet at all."" Huh???  SO we go to the parking garage and the sign says there's 100+ parking spaces, buuuuut there were none - on more than one floor.  The garage itself is poorly designed, as if they just tried to fit as many cars into one tiny space as they could.  Parallel parking spaces in a parking garage?  Seriously?  It took us almost an hour just to find a spot.  And that's just the parking.  When we walk into the hotel, it is gorgeous.  The art is digital, hip and pretty cool.  The chandelier is AMAZING to look at.  Aesthetically, the Cosmopolitan is very pleasing.  However, that's about all the props it gets.  I asked a worker where to go to pick up tickets, and they said ""I don't know.  I think the pool is on the 5th floor, though."" (Despite the sign right next to him saying that it's on the 4th floor.)  Apparently, ""I don't know"" was the phrase of the night for most of the staff, because nobody knew anything.  Two people actually directed us to Marquee after I asked them where the Boulevard Pool was.  Some of them didn't even know about a concert at all.  Communication much?  After asking 8 different people (no exaggeration), and 30 more minutes of walking around, I finally found ONE man who told me where to pick up my tickets.     Did I mention the inside is just as much a maze as the parking garage?  The escalators are not close to eachother at all, and I felt like I was going in circles.  I was dizzy by the time I reached will-call.  Needless to say, chances are, I will not be going back.  For a place that is supposed to be new and hip and for all the hype it gets, that's all it is - hype."
6082,train,-1,"I have been to this hotel on and off since it open its doors. stayed in there back in 2013 and then several times visited the night club since in 2015 and 2014. it is the most unsanitary dump I have ever seen. the elevators reek of marijuana all the time, the rooms are filthy with dirty carpets and bed sheets and even in several occasions their clean towels looked so nasty. This is really not acceptable for an expensive hotel in Vegas. The staff have been more or less incompetent and unapologetic. it seems the whole hotel is tailored for average  drug dealers and gang-bangers. you really feel like you are in da hood walking in this hotel. I'd really avoid this dump at any cost"
8056,train,1,"My favorite hotel in Vegas.  Awesome customer service from the staff (registration, Identity desk, dealers, etc).  My Casino Host offered to send a car to pick me up from the airport...    Except for the base City Room, I believe all rooms have balconies.  Not many hotels on the strip have balconies for their rooms--at least, not the affordable rooms...  My players membership comes with 2 free wifi connections.  I get wifi all over cosmo and am not limited to just in my room as in most other casinos...  The Marquee night club is the best night club in Vegas and, in some reviews, best in the USA.  Update:  I tried the Day club during the 2012 Labor Day weekend.  I loved it.  Great layout with the covered areas, dance floor, bed, and DJ.  Also fabulous & friendly staff!  IMO, the Cosmo Wicked Spoon Buffet is the 2nd best buffet in Vegas, following Bellagio's (the M casino offers a wide selection of food but the quality of the food is OK).   The pizza at Secret Pizza is really good.  I usually have a slice to close out the night.  The people that stay at the Cosmo is from the younger generation so the chicks that walk around the casino are hot!    The Boulevard and Bamboo pools are cozy to hang around at.  The Chandelier Bar has to be the best pure bar on the strip.  And very important....  I sometimes win when I gamble here!  LoL"
7886,train,1,"I love this hotel, normally stay here when I am in Las Vegas, great location, great views of the strip, the location is very central and easy to walk to anything."
1956,train,0,"Paradise. Where? I'm still looking. What a funny name. I never did figure it quite out. I wonder who named this place and when... 50 years ago when it was built. Does paradise smell like stinky butts and body odor. The carpet is the origins motif and so is the couch. The beds mattress was a good brand just ancient. I must say opening the doors helped a bit, just not nearly enough. Hard to sleep good though on lumps and smelly carpets. At least the sheets were clean. Whoopee. On the up side, they did have new appliances. And the gym is really decent for a hotel/timeshare. It had free weights and decent leg machines, a smith machine and cables. At least my body is in shape but my back sure isn't. Oh one last final note, I forgot to mention the showers run cold to cool. If you decide to stop by at the paradise resort (Ha!), make sure they turn up the water heater for you or you might extinguish what you came to Vegas for."
5722,train,1,"Hip, Modern, Flashy, Chic, Well Decorated, Fun. Basically everything a hotel and casino should be in Vegas. Close to a bunch of fun places, we got a room overlooking the Bellagio water show, pretty damn sweet. Tons of pools and a solid club, no reason to leave the place really ever... But that's the idea right!? Fun."

4977,test,0,Not ready to give a full review but having to wait in line to check in at 10:25 pm was not making me happy!  Only 3 check in clerks with plenty of people waiting to check in.  Hope this is not a preview of what is to come.  Update: finally got checked in and they upgraded our room to one bedroom terrace suite.  I did hear the clerk next to us updating another couple so I am thinking they just gave us what they had available as hotel was 100% occupancy. We needed a refrigerator and it was delivered free of charge to our room.  Good location.  Update at end of our stay:  ok this was a nice hotel as pool area was nice.  I am not sorry we stayed here but most likely will not stay here again as I feel other places are just as nice and rooms are most likely just as nice.  This hotel does have a private terrace for each room so that is a plus as many of the hotels to not provide this.  The main thing that really bothered me was the shower.  There was no controlling the water for hot and cold and seemed to work hap-hazardly.  Lastly the hotel does not go over and above anything.  We asked for late check out as our flight does not leave until 10:45 pm so we are getting another room for the day at Westin to hang out until we have to go to the airport for our long journey home.
9920,train,1,"Rob L. nailed it, this was a surprising gem.   I wanted something close to the Jackson Barrett Auto Auction, this worked perfectly. Even better they had a shuttle bus to/from the event so we could over indulge in cocktails without any care!   Looking around the place I don't think any room would have a bad view. Our room overlooked the desert, hearing the coyotes cry at night was spooky!...but very cool. I won't bore you with the details but it's a very attractive place. What finally nailed it for me was the down pillows and sheets, one of the best night's sleeps I've had in ages. Whoever designed the room really thought of everything down to the toilet seat that doesn't slam down!    The service was mostly good. I called and asked if we could check in early and they said the room would be ready in an hour...awesome! The concierge and front desk staff always had a smile and were helpful. The valet and drivers were VERY cool and fun. The maid was sweet with a big smile. However, the woman bartender (with a Jamaican accent?) was terrible.  No worries.   Next time I'm in the area I'll be staying here again. Good Job!"
6890,train,1,This was my first time staying here and I have no major complaints. The location was great in the middle of the strip. The restaurant choices were great and enjoyed several fabulous dinners while here. The lounge options were fun and plentiful as well. The multiple pools to choose from were excellent. They pools had a good amount of people but were not overly crowded. The room was spacious and clean. This hotels has everything you could ever want for your Vegas visit. I would definitely stay here again. Our room was was over the Marquee Day Pool Party/Club and you could clearly hear the loud music and crowd day and night however I'm not a light sleeper and didn't mind.
30,train,-1,"My family and I came over to this casino for one reason: a foot long (1/2 pound) hot dog for 99 cents. We had seen a show on the Food Network about hot dogs and this place was one of the cheap ones. So, we tried it and didn't think much of it; it tasted like a big roll of bologna. I guess if you are a huge bologna fan, you'll really enjoy it. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to go gaga for."
316,test,-1,"This hotel or should I say ""HOE MOE TEL"" should be shut down for good. It is the worst place I have ever stayed and I settled for this because of a last minute need to get to Vegas! I was kept up all night with loud guest in the hallway and pounding on the doors. After getting up to see what was going on I saw half dressed females.. this hotel was booked online and we drove around looking for the location for several minutes after coming to a dead end, using map quest directions..NO HOT Water, no face towels, light from hallway shining through door frame all night, freeway noises all night long.. Continental breakfast is a joke as well it's a dump period....beware......Just saying..."
6403,test,0,"Booked a room with balcony..when we arrived there were no balcony rooms left. Put us in a regular room. We were given a credit. Moved us the next day to a balcony suite..which is kind of a hassle to pack up & move. After staying 1st night in suite we left to a meeting & when we returned in evening..room was not cleaned. Manager credited my spa charge at checkout. I found it unusual too when you call spa, room service, front desk..phone rings & rings before someone picks up. The balcony is super neat but in my opinion, the place is too pricey for what you get."

2629,train,1,"I stayed here last May 2015 during the big fight weekend. The Four Seasons in Vegas has to be the best place I've stayed at in Sin City. I've stayed at places such as the Wynn, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, Paris, Monte Carlo, The Palms, MGM, Ballys, Treasure Island, Hard Rock and all the way down to Circus Circus as well as Excalibur. FS steals the show with exceptional service and comfort. Their staff actually seem to care about your questions and requests. The suite was truly beautiful which is what you expect with a brand like theirs. It happened to be a big milestone birthday of mine and they even had a small complimentary cake, a birthday card and a spa discount for me. It was such a fun touch! The front desk agents are extremely attentive and receive you in a lobby/reception area with a swanky bar that makes you feel like you're stepping into ultimate luxury. If you don't drink, they have water ready for you while you relax and wait if you check-in early. The advantage of staying here is that even though it's attached to the Mandalay Bay you can feel detached from the gambling/hysteria of Vegas when you want and then easily cross-over into the fun mayhem of it all. I am just reaffirming what so many people have written about this stellar hotel. The service outpaces any Vegas property by far! It's worth every penny! My sister made a comment saying that if we could stay here every single time...we would!  I wish I could find the card of the Manager that I took away with me and personally thank him or her. Well deserved five stars!  P.S. The pool isn't as big as Mandalay Bay but it was still really pretty."
2372,train,-1,"I wouldn't stay at this hotel, even for free. The last time I stayed here which was about a year ago during CES and the main reason why we picked that place was because the rate was less than $100 a night vs. over $200 in others.   On the second day of my stay, I got back to my room after the show, and I noticed that my favorite bracelet that I left on the counter was gone. I clearly remembered leaving it on the counter, but forgot to put it away before I left the room that morning.  It was definitely the maid or someone got into the room while we were out. I was really upset and filed a report. Unfortunately, once it's lost, it's gone forever. There's close to zero chance of recovering it.  I found out who cleaned the room that day and approached her the next day, but of course she kept repeating the same words - No Bracelet. No, I don't know.     Of course, it's my fault too for leaving a valuable jewelry out on the counter, but it never crossed my mind that someone would actually steal stuff from my hotel room.  Ironically, I met an older couple in the elevator that very evening, and the husband said that their room got broken into that morning, and someone had somehow opened up their safe and taken over $10K worth of their personal belongings. They didn't seem like a couple that would make up a story like that. But one things' for sure. I'm never staying at the hotel again!   Ever since that experience, I opted not to have my room cleaned again, and leave the do not disturb sign outside my door. Better to be safe than sorry, right?"
5804,test,1,"By far the best hotel casino in Vegas. We had a blast there. Fun crowd, good looking people, great bars and restaurant and awesome club! The room were really nice and the staff was always very polite and helpful. I will definitely stay at the Cosmo again!"
8700,train,1,"First off, this is no longer called CHAPARREL SUITES, it's now one of Hilton's EMBASSY SUITES and for quality, price and location it's probably as good as it gets in the Old Town vicinity.  Suites are large, well appointed and most importantly for me QUIET. I had the guy in the next room apologize because his infant was crying all night and I told him I never heard a sound---walls must be 3 feet thick concrete!  Had two housekeeping issues and both were seen to and corrected immediately.  Hot Breakfast included and quite good too! Also offer an afternoon Happy Hour with free snacks!!  It ain't the Ritz but for what is, a reasonably priced suites hotel in a great location with an attentive staff, I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel to my fellow Yelpers for sure!!"
9215,train,1,Beautiful resort with great amenities. Amazing staff & customer service. We stayed here for our anniversary and the staff helped make this a very memorable getaway. There was a complimentary chocolate & fruit plate waiting for us in our room. We got upgraded to a room with better view for no extra cost. Had a great dinner at Prado restaurant and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon poolside at the adults-only pool.
4910,train,0,"This place is nice to look at and stay in. I would rate it much higher if the food offerings were better.   In regards to the hotel, I think anyone would be very impressed by the decor and bling! The technology was impressive and it definitely attracted the beautiful and trendy crowd.  Stay there, just don't waste your money eating there!"
7248,train,-1,"Bear & I were in Vegas for the Magic Fashion Show, Feb 15 - 18. We stayed at the Cosmo which we've wanted to try for a long time  I cannot describe my excitement as we rolled into their driveway. But they left much to be desired.   We had our reservations + a free upgrade offer that they had emailed us. I mentioned it when I called in to tell them that we're not arriving later & guest services asked if there was anything special we wanted in our room like a tub or something like that & we asked for a stove since we were gonna be there for several days. They said that it could definitely be accommodated based on availability.   We walked up to the front desk where Mr. NoPersonality  helped us. We showed the printed offer & mentioned the stove & he found us a room with a kitchen, charged the deposit & sent us on our way. When we got to the room, there was no stove. There was a microwave & a sink. The room itself was nice but the view was of some horrible parking structure, but what can you do. We were kind of disappointed but I love eating out so I quickly got over it.   Later on, I decided to take a bath in their beautiful bathroom which was open to the living room, kinda exciting, BUT when I went to fill the tub, I noticed a black ring around the tub which clearly hadn't been cleaned. I called the front desk, they apologized, but they couldn't move us till the next morning.   The next day I mentioned the stove again, & they us found us one, but said we had to pay an extra $100 for the remaining nights. I wasn't happy because clearly they had said that with the upgrade offer this would be free, not to mention that they places us in a dirty room, but they didn't even try to make amends, just said sorry about that over and over. We negotiated & brought it down to $50/night. Our new room was gorgeous & the view was fantastic, the kitchen was complete & the bathtub was clean.   Later we noticed some issues with our new room as well & thought they weren't bad enough to switch rooms over, they did make me question Cosmos true quality. Is it all empty words for a lot of money, or did we just get the two worst rooms they had to present? There were cleanable stains here & there, we had holes in our sheets, the kitchen didn't have anything in it... I understand they send up clean dishes & utensils when you ask them, but could they keep some dish washing products in the room, or send them up with the dishes so we don't have to call for every bowl & fork which takes 30 mins to arrive forcing us to wash our dishes with shampoo and small towels.    I can't see myself going back to Cosmo, which is what I said about Vdara, but staying in these rooms where the basics aren't covered, I feel like I owe Vdara an apology.   ------RESTAURANTS  On the 1st night we ordered from Holsteins. Brought the food back to our room & boy was it disappointing. The food was good, but some of the portions were made for a doll house. Our bill came out to $67 which isn't bad but not really appropriate for the amount of food.   AHI POKE TOSTADA $15 - We thought we would get a decent amount of AHI. But we got two dressing cups of AHI & the ""tostada"" just happened to be 6 pieces of round Tortilla Chips. 6 pieces only! Pictures will be attached.   TRUFFLE LOBSTER 'MAC N CHEESE' $16.50 - Not the best Lobster Mac N Cheese I've had but definitely the best dish of the night. Definitely think they could have put more in there but seeing the AHI we also know they could have put way less so lets just be grateful.   POUTINE $13 - This dish could have won my heart because it had all the right things, but the gravy was dripped on for what I think might have been decorational reasons & overall it felt very dry.   MILKSHAKES $9 - Chocolate & Malt for Bear & Strawberry for me. Yum!   ------ On the last night, we decided to try one more restaurant in the Hotel, China Poblano. We were under the impression that they had some cool hybrids & we got curious. The place was empty, but they didn't let us in without reservations so we got the food to go. The bill came out to $79, total Waste.   Open Sesame noodles $9.88 - Went straight into the trash.   Chicken Ji Song Lettuce Cups  - $16.88 - The only tasty dish, but there were only 4 baby romaine leafs (size of endives).    Mongolian Beef Lettuce $18.88 - It was bad, like really bad. The beef came in chunks & the lettuce really clashed. Also went into the trash.   Siu Mai Quail Eggs $16.88 - Yikes.   ------ After getting back to the room and seeing that China Poblano is causing a death wish in us, we went straight to Secret Pizza, ordered a few different ones which were ok, but the THICK WHITE PIZZA was bomb! I must express my appreciation this pizza place because after all the bad food, it kinda felt like flavor was nothing but a dream never to be found again, but Secret Pizza reassured us that flavor is still out there. The next morning we had a great meal at the Aria and got back on the road. Goodbye 4-ever Cosmo!"
6765,test,1,"I love the restaurants at the Cosmo, especially Comme Ca and Scarpetta.  The chandelier bar is the perfect place to get together with friends and enjoy some nice cocktails, although on the weekend it may be a bit hard to hear each other.  A great spot for locals on the weekdays to bar hop and enjoy great cocktails."
5871,train,1,Booked the terrace studio with the balcony and fountain view. It was seriously amazing. Had an issue when we arrived and our key cards weren't working so we were waiting outside our room for about 20 minutes..after we got in our room we heard a knock at the door and the front desk sent a letter apologizing along with a box of chocolates. The service was so great here!
1017,train,1,"I vaguely remember trying to find this place in a drunken frenzy in the wee hours of the morning after a ridiculous night of drinking. Sadly, the alcohol got the best of us and we failed to find it. HOWEVER, we were still craving it the next day and sobriety was on our side and we found it! I had the eggs benedict, but instead of your ol' run of the mill benedict w/canadian bacon...it had filet mignon! OMG. Heaven in my mouth. Really. Enough said."
5392,test,0,"The shower head and water pressure  is amazing. Don't expect much from this place. Was comped a two night stay and it was perfect for what I got being free. Place is close to MGM and NYNY. Would I stay again? Sure, if free. Ate at Hooters food joint and it was okay. Do not order original recipe on wings, unless you like your fried chicken wings bland."
8977,train,1,"i stayed here with my boyfriend once. i must say i was kind of effy about this hotel, because it was off the strip and i didnt agree with him that it was going to be good but i guess it all changed the moment we arrived  we checked in and the lady named Tatiana greeted us and gave us such wonderful costumer service. she was so nice, and she know what she was doing. she also explained everything to us very clear! so THANK YOU!  we got the keys to our room and when we entered it, it was JUST LIKE THE PICTURES. very CLEAN, NICE, and well Renovated!   their bed was very comfortable! i was surprise on how good it felt. i took a shower and i used their lotion. I LOVE THE SMELL! i LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. when we check out i asked the cleaning lady if i can take an extra one and she gave me 2! hehe looking forward to say here again!!!"
2072,train,-1,"Having stayed at Four Seasons properties all over the world, we were excited to check out the Vegas property! Unfortunately, it was an utter let down.   We usually stay at the Bellagio, renting two bedroom penthouse suites. Being the week before Christmas, everything was pretty cheap in Vegas. we could have stayed at Bellagio for $700 per night. Instead, we chose a $1400 suite at the Four Seasons. At check in we were offered an upgrade to the Presidential Suite for $1700 per night. We were very excited. Then we walked into the supposed presidential suite and realized we had been scammed. It was smaller than what we traditionally stay in at the Bellagio, and was outdated. In both our bathroom and my daughters, I had to work on the showerhead to get them to function properly... It was extremely windy the first night, and we had a whistling through the windows that kept us up the entire night. When we called engineering they came up with a roll of blue painters tape and covered our window frames in tape. This worked partially, and gave the appearance of the blue man group performing in our room! As a sidenote, the engineer mentioned they have many presidential suites on property, and have the same issues throughout.  The service was fine, but nothing special. When you are willing to spend the kind of money we spent, you tend to expect things to be right. In 15 years of staying with this property chain, it was the first time I felt like I had been ripped off! I could have spent half as much money for a far superior room if I had stayed down the street. Funny they never asked for our feedback..."
3954,train,0,"I have stayed here 2 times.  I am completely in love with the Four Seasons brand hotels.  Unfortunately, for this location, they are connected to the Mandalay Bay.  And MB SUCKS horribly!  I have never had a pleasant experience at MB or THEHotel.  If you stay at the FS, you use the same facilities at guests at the MB.  Namely the pool.  So, 3 stars is all they get...."
7397,train,1,"Debated between a few hotels on the strip, but wanted modern amenities near the action and got it all here.  JetBlue upgraded us for free to a suite which made the package and stay better than expected.  Close to other attractions, good service, and clean!  For the price, we couldn't be happier"
7861,test,-1,"I would love to give this hotel a four star rating. The facilities are nice. The shops and food are very good. And the suites are well set up for entertaining.  However, the way the management responded to a noise incident makes it impossible for me to do so.  You know how I mentioned those suites are well set up for entertaining? That's what a group I was with was doing. We had a private event and when the party got going, it was loud. But it wasn't any louder than events I've been to in hotel suites over many years for both professional and personal reasons.  It would have been perfectly reasonable for the hotel to send security to shut the party down and require everyone to leave in response to the noise. And if that is what happened I'd probably have given the hotel the four star review its facilities warrant.  But the response of management, while absolutely within its rights, was excessive. They shut the party down and required everyone to leave. That's fine. What they also did is why I am giving they hotel one star.   They evicted the people who paid for the suite. You read that right. They tossed them out of the hotel.  The Cosmopolitan had the absolute right to do this. But people looking to book an event in the suites should be aware of this policy. They have a no tolerance policy and if they decide your event is too loud, this could happen to you."
2662,train,1,"What a wonderful experience.  We arrived on a Sunday which is a pretty quiet day in Vegas.  Check-in was pretty uneventful.  The room is nice, I wouldn't call it extraordinary, but it is clean and well maintained.  The hotel is about 10 years old, so it definitely feels that way.  The room has two thick robes, plenty of towels, L'Occitane products, a seperate toilet off the main bathroom, one sink, a counter, hair dryer, a deep soaking tub and a rug in front of the sink.  There is a turn-down service at night which is a nice touch.  They even will switch out your towels and tidy up the room so it is ready when you get back later in the evening.  We went out to the pool each day.  It is a pretty small pool that is only 3.5-4 feet deep.  However, it is very private and thus pretty quiet.  You will get an Evian spritzer about once an hour, a complimentary small dixie cup drink, complimentary pitcher of water with lemon.  They will also set you up with a towel that is designed to fit around the lounge chair and a thick towel.  The ground is not cooled like at the Bellagio, but you are close enough to the pool in every seat as to not have to walk far to get into the pool.    The gym is very nice.  There is plenty of cardio equipment and a fair amount of machines.  There is a towel, new clean headphones at each cardio machine.  There is also complimentary gatorade and water as well as newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal, Las Vegas Journal, USA today and the NY Times.  The cardio equipment all have tv's with limited cable.  The spa also has a sauna and a very clean locker room with robes, apples, chilled towels and very clean showers and lounge area.    Everyone that we met from reception to the housekeepers to the bell caps to the house car driver were all super.  We did have a small issue with the room which was resolved when we checked out to my satisfaction.  Matt R, the Assistant Manager took care of us and was very friendly and understanding.  Thanks Matt!  The hotel offers complimentary shoe shines if you leave your shoes on your door by 1am.  The shoes are returned by 7am that same morning.  They even sent up a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  It was very tasty.  We were offered a ride to the airport in the house car even though they usually just go down the strip towards the Wynn/Encore.  There is only one house car and it is available on a first-come basis.  With all of the amenities, great customer service and complimentary services, it is worth paying a little bit extra to stay here.  On a Sunday to Tuesday stay like ours, it was well worth it.  We'll be back."
5325,train,1,Last night in town of a incredible weekend. The cosmopolitan is an great hotel to stay if you want to be in a trendy chic environment.  The casinos was OK but they are more known for their suite with amazing views. We stayed in the king suite with a terrace. Incredible is all I have to say. Room service was great along with the staff. The night life here is what's it's all about. Marque is a really trendy night club on the second floor. Shopping and dining is excellent but really to me the best part is definitely the views overlooking the Bellagio and Caesar's  palace. Unbelievable experience. I can't wait to come back!!!!
9197,train,1,"The Omni Resort is amazing. The staff is wonderful, the food was fantastic the yoga classes were magical and the spa services were perfect. The view from our bedroom was amazing! We fell in love with Grandpa Frank who was in the restaurant! We will be back for sure!!"
2114,test,1,"This resort is worthy of a 6 star, but extra clicks next to the 5th star didn't produce and extra star....  This place fires on every cylinder possible.  Everything, and I mean everything, about this place is impressive - doesn't matter what entrance you walk in, what person you talk to, what restaraunt you eat at... it's all excellent.  Upon entering, if you've been to Belagio, Wynn, Encore, Caesars... what I would consider the top notch casinos on the strip... you aren't greeted with any fancy fountains, erupting volcanos, circus acts, you are just greeted with elegance.  Elegance dashed with ultra contemporary, and at every turn, excellence in artistic work, from sculptures to paintings, and even the design elements are artistic in nature.  The lobby pillars are huge, huge tv's where the pillars rotate themes, from sultry dancing, to libraries, etc.  It's really stunning.  The service... impeccible.  anytime I talked to someone about anything I needed or just for conversation they were above friendly and helpful.  The room, wow.  Stunning.  These rooms were designed as lofts, and it shows, you really feel at home walking into the place, and the fact that your clock/radio has everything from the weather and complete control over the lighting in the room is fantastic.  The layout is fantastic with multiple large screen TVs and the living room TV swivels around, to boot.  I'll be back... Oh yeah, I'll be back."
2436,train,-1,"Attended a conference here in September. It gets 1 star for location alone. The rooms were sub par, I didn't get the accommodations I had reserved in the first place, and housekeeping was inconsistent.   Wifi? Forget it in your room and also cell phone service as well (I personally have Verizon)   I'd never pay my own money to stay in this hotel when you have options like the William Penn Omni or the Westin which are well worth your money. Thank goodness this bill was on my employer."
4540,train,-1,Okay where do I start my overall experience was a diaster.  Having stayed at so many hotels in Vegas I must say this was the worse.  First off they give us the wrong room we made reservations for two. We asked for a roll away bed they decided to give this to us the morning that we were checking out. They never answered when we would call for services they did not accomodate us. You would think you would get good service what you pay for. I know cant ask more for a cheesy theme for a hotel but seriously thought theyd be professional about their business. They made our stay far from enjoyable and comfortable. There wasnt enough staff far as waitress never received service while we were gambling. I just have to say I would never go back In my experience wouldnt recommend it . I would rather sleep in my car hope this was helpful to you.. They get  a Big F
3790,train,1,"No, this is not a 4 star hotel, but perspective people!  I paid $89.99 CDN (taxes in) for a hotel room a 5 minute walk from The Bell Centre on the night Paul McCartney was playing there!  Rooms were very clean and nicely decorated, staff was competent and efficient.  Nice little pool area and bar, and the standard 15 bucks a night for parking.  Bottom line, an older, well maintained hotel with a great location and close to the cheapest price in the city.  A 2 1/2 - 3 star hotel with a 5 star location and price."
3007,train,1,"Awesome show. Beautiful girls. Very well choreographed. Worth watching.  Tip: If you are VIP - it's first come first serve VIP seats. General admission - it's the same first come first serve.  Cons:  I don't think it's worth paying $70 for VIP if you come early with general admission. I had a VIP tickets for six and was seated in general admission because they over sold plus they couldn't put my party together.   If you are seated on the top most row. Which will happen if all the good visual seats are taken you will miss 1/3 rd of the show because you cannot see any of the pole dancing, dancing with the audience.   The last top most row should be completely closed of.   But overall a very good show to see."
4183,train,-1,"When booking here, I wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel. But....really....we found a vibrator under the AC unit....

398,train,0,"This is a rough revue to write, because some elements of Montelucia are fantastic, bordering on 5 stars.  The staff, Prado restaurant, the pools, the view of Camelback Mountain...all great!  I was there for business recently, and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms of the ""Winter Delight"" special.  Basically had to manage it myself to make sure the credits that had been offered were, in fact, given.  Lots of my time spent resolving it, and in the end, they clarified and corrected the terms, but nothing more.  It should have been a seamless process for a guest.  Just that week they changed over to new ownership, Omni, and it seems are still working out their systems. This is my second visit to Scottsdale and so far I prefer the Hyatt Gainey Ranch for hotels. Would definitely drive over to Montelucia to have dinner at Prado though (ask to sit in Nathan's section, and have the kale salad!)."

2174,train,-1,"It is HARD to find reasonably priced accommodations during MLB Spring Training in March....so we decided to try this moderately priced establishment that promised much larger rooms then you would normally get at this price point.  The hotel is, for the most part, freshly painted on the outside, but that is as far as it goes.  The interiors, while spacious with a kitchenette are HORRIBLY still living in the 80's.  Everything needs to be replaced and repainted.... I will leave it at that.  I've included some pics, including the furnace filter that was probably last changed in 1990...  I will give it kudos for the pool area, very clean, nice lounge chairs and a great covered meeting  area.  The tennis courts and basketball courts are all weeded and cracked.    If someone wanted to sump some serious cash into this place it would be the bomb!"

7583,train,-1,"Really?  Are you kidding?  The kudos needs to go the marketing team and the ad agency who branded this hotel so successfully.  It's all flash and very little substance.  It's like whatever was on sale at some discount hotel supply store was thrown together into a very crowded hodge-podge of ""design"" and ""art.""  Brand it as edgy and ""wrong,"" and you've got an identity that needs to deliver.  Just touch the 3 story chandelier and you'll quickly realize it's all cheap plastic.  That says it all.  If you're looking for an edgier version of The Palms, you'll enjoy the show.  John"
7015,train,1,"This hotel has changed a lot in the past few years for the better (I believe they were sold to a different company). I stay here probably once every few months and can say that every room here is a good choice.   If you have the money the ONLY other hotel that beats the Cosmo is the Wynn/Encore and that's if luxury and service is your main focus. If you're looking for an upscale place to party/mingle with people in their 20s then definitely choose this hotel (the Cosmo).   Rooms: - If you're with more than 3 people get the wraparound terrace suite and ask for rollaway beds. This suite is HUGE like 1,200 sq ft.  - Terrace suites are good choices for parties of 2.  - Do not get an angle suite.  - Any of the suites come with a fridge/freezer, stove, and an oven. I doubt anyone cooks in Vegas, but if you're looking to save money then bringing/cooking your own food in the rooms will definitely equate to about $200-500 off of the total price depending on the number of people in your party and the places you eat out.  - The bedding sometime smells off. This is the way that they wash the sheets and I guess it's to be ignored or you can call and ask them to change your sheets to new ones and they'll know what you mean.   Dining: - Try the in room dining for breakfast at least once. It's better than most of the restaurants at this resort.  - Eat at China Poblana (Mexican and Chinese fusion, don't be scared and order the ""when pigs fly"" and guacamole) - Eat at DOCG and order the veal Parmesan (Italian restaurant next to Scarpetta)  - ""Secret"" pizza place adjacent to the sushi place and the Spanish place. Really good pizza - SKIP EVERY other restaurant at the resort. You'll be disappointed and will have spent a lot of money.   Criticism: - You will want to bring your own cosmetics since the shampoo, conditioner, soap and mouthwash is pretty bad here. Actually, the mouthwash is laughably bad."

Outside of the wedding, the room service was expensive and nothing special, but that's to be expected of room service. We went to the restaurant downstairs for the breakfast buffet, which was really great, but had a horrendous wait time, even though there were plenty of open tables! The meal was also pretty expensive and I asked my server if I could take the remaining food on my plate in a to-go-box with me on the road because I didn't want to waste it and we were in a hurry, but he said that was against policy. I understood where he was coming from, since diners could obviously abuse the policy, but in a situation in which the food was going to be thrown away anyway, perhaps an exception could have been made."

7696,test,0,"REVIEW FOR THE TERRACE STUDIO:  We stayed for 3 nights during the weekday. (Parking was great and apparently we got a good deal as well.) Our room was located on the 55th floor of the East Tower which gave us a view of Marquee and the pools when we lounged outside on our terrace.   Now onto the room. The room was amazingly spacious. At the same time you're able to have privacy between each room by simply pulling on the door divider. One plus in my book about this place was that not only did they provide bath robes, but slippers as well. YAY! Along with your expected toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion) Q-tips and cotton balls were provided as well. (It's the little things that matter!) Not only did the room come with a minibar/fridge, it also had a sink, microwave, and dishwasher. (But didnt leave a set of silverware or dishes for us so was the kitchen area just for looks?) The shower itself is a bit on the weak side when it comes to water power. The 2 people square bath tub looks out onto the terrace so it provides a nice view while you relax in the tub.  Would have given this place 4 star if it weren't for the following reasons:  -2 TVs with only 1 remote. Made it difficult to change the channel on the televisions when one was located in the living area while the other in the bedroom. -Did not grant us late check out. In all the years that I have been going to Vegas, hotels have been courteous in allowing guests to check out an hour later. This one didn't.  -Upon checking in to our room, the ash tray was not emptied and the bathroom supply was not restocked with shower gel. -Room was missing ""Do Not Disturb"" sign so every morning at 9am, housekeeping came a knocking :( -Adamant Housekeeper. Usually this is a plus but when I just woke up and we told her we don't want housekeeping, she insisted on coming in saying it would take only 10 minutes. Not only was it awkward watching the woman work, after 10 minute has passed she was still cleaning up the place so we were forced out of the room in a sense :(  I'm hoping my next stay would be a 4+ Star that Cosmo is known for."
7142,train,-1,"Huge customer service failure.  I'm sitting in my room right now with no Internet connectivity, no working phone in the room, no tv, an unstocked minibar, a previous guest's trash in the drawers and cabinets, and have called the front desk 4 times asking for an audio cable to plug my iPad into the entertainment center.  When I went to the front desk asking for a status on the communications/entertainment issues, I was told guests were warned the day before.  That doesn't help because I checked in today to an unkept room. The front desk and operators (had to call on my cell phone) were not remotely helpful or sympathetic to the awful hotel experience I'm enduring.  I'm at the point where it's adversely affecting my valuable vacation time and cannot work due to the lack of connectivity. A little genuine sympathy or compensation for guests is the logical answer, but right now it seems like nobody in the hotel is getting it."
254,train,1,"Yes this is a Vegas rathole.  If you eat here, you have only yourself to blame.  But hold on....  These are some of the cheapest tables on the strip.  Single deck blackjack, none of those stupid reshuffling machines, and a great place for card counters.  You'll see card counters jumping in with everything they got onto a table at the right moment, and walk away with their loot.  They can't afford Guido here.  You're missing out on the real Vegas if you don't play a few hands at Slots A Fun.  It should be a traditional stop on your Strip tour."

HD tv channels, nice towels...  Dinner was excellent. I chose a grilled chicken dish with roasted vegetables, apricots, and a Madeira sauce. All in all you can't go wrong here, I'd stay again in a heartbeat. AND the shuttle runs every half hour 24 hours."
5683,train,1,"I had a beautiful stay here, it was a comp stay and I had a suite. What a beautiful room ! I loved everything about it and felt like a king. The room is so high tech with the light switches and the bathroom. I loved the tub and soaking in it at night while taking in the view of the fountain show at the bellagio!  Staff at check in and check out were every friendly to me. The Identity rewards people were also very kind and informative about stuff. Lots of restaurants and shopping places here too. Only down fall for me was the lack of craps tables. There always seemed to be only one table open when I would walk by and it was always full... but they have three other tables that were closed, so that was weird. But I really can't be upset about that as the room was just so awesome and I enjoyed every night I was there very much.  Thank you so much cosmopolitan staff for everything ! I truly felt valued to be here as a guest and really enjoyed my time here !!"
1719,train,1,"WorldMark Las Vegas is located 3 miles from the strip.     If you have a car, staying on the strip is not a big deal.  It's a very short drive to the strip and freeways.  It's conveniently located to local supermarket, Walgreen is down the street just incase you need to grab something at the pharmacy.   With kids,  you never know.  I wasn't really expecting much staying here.  We stayed in a renovated 2 bedroom.   Everything look new.  Unit had everthing we look for,  living room, kitchen, washer and dryer which is located behind the door on the patio balcony, odd location.  Everything function and unit kept clean.  There are no elevators at this resort, something to keep in mind.  Came here during winter, so we did not use the pool.  If your not looking for high end resort and don't care about staying on the strip, this is a good place to checkout.  Request a unit not facing Tropicana Ave, it's a main street with car noise 24/7, very noisy.   Too others, noise doesn't really bother them."

4707,train,1,"Loved it!  I'm very particular about hotels, and the Cosmo did not disappoint. Everything in the room was relatively new considering that it has been open for at least two years(?). Upkeep here is phenomenal, and their service staff is on point. I checked out of the room at 10:30AM, and someone was at the door at 10:35am to ensure the room was empty. Crazy!  Check in can be a bit cray around 3pm, so I suggest trying to check in as soon as you arrive. The front desk will remotely activate your key and text you the room information - I've never seen that done at another hotel.  Amenities (CO Bigelow) were a nice touch and a good size. Note that the lotion does contain mineral oil - clogs your pores!  Definitely on my list for Vegas - look out for the deals!"

Again, exceptionally friendly front desk staff on all 3 days of my stay made this a memorable experience.  If you find that the 'other' place down the street is booked (as I did) or too expensive, do not fret!  You'll love it here.  I did not try any food service so I can't comment I that."
9912,train,1,"Stayed here: 09/16 - 09/18-11  This is one of the few places that I like to stay off the strip when Vegas is having a ""busy"" weekend. Busy meaning big concerts, UFC or boxing weekend or else a ton of conventions. And I really don't want to spend 300+ a night for a room since these events hike the prices of the hotel rooms.  Candlewood Suites is perfectly fine to me. I have stayed here many times when coming to Vegas. This hotel is close to some pretty good restaurants, Mortons, Buca Di Beppo, Firefly and other restaurants are all walking distance. There's even a Starbucks across the street for some early morning coffee (even though your room comes with a coffee maker and coffee) or even a mid day frapp! Terrible's is across the street for gambling/sportsbetting purposes and Hard Rock is about a 10 minute walk.  You can also walk to the strip from here. It will take you about 10-15 minutes.  Or you can wait for the public transportation to come. (which is across the street as well)  Sign up for the Priority Club. So that you can get the small perks and rewards. It's very helpful. (Its not much, but this hotel gives you a free soda upon check-in)  Everything seemed the same from what I remember. Attentive front desk, friendly staff, small lounge area for your guests to wait for you to come down. (they can enjoy sports  or whatever the staff is watching on the 42 inch flat screen in the waiting area) They also have a small convenient shop (for hotel guests only) This shop includes everything from TV dinners, ice cream, sodas, milk, juices, fruit, toiletries that you may have forgotten on your trip and a good variety of chips to choose from.   There is a gym right next to the convenient shop (for those of you who want to work out on your vacation). Pretty descent size. And the pool is in the back of the hotel.  The studio suite is always fine to me. Especially since I was just going by myself. Comes with a kitchen, microwave (they give you a nice surprise when you open the microwave (free popcorn!)), small stove, recliner and a comfortable bed. Bathroom is descent. Comes with pantine pro v shampoo and conditioner and their company soap. Showerhead also gave off a good amount of pressure.   Overall I had a good experience. Candlewood Suites is very simple, but yet comfortable and relaxing as well. I would definitely recommend it."
9662,train,1,"This little hotel is great for a vegas trip on a budget. Has everything you could as for. I usually stay at the higher-end (stayed at the Palazzo this past summer for example) but this quaint hotel meets all the bottom line criteria for Vegas. Staff was friendly and helpful, our room was always CLEAN (most important!!), and location was EXCELLENT. Only knew about this place because it was a girls trip and my friend stayed there before, I was hesitant because I could tell in the trip advisor pics the hotel was older, but it was great!! No regrets and will definitely stay there again! So glad I know about this place now.   Oh, and they even sent me back my dress I had forgotten in the room! Wasn't cheap so very much appreciate them finding and returning!  Great place!! You'd have to be a super snob to pass this up! Thanks Jockey Club!"
7513,train,-1,"This hotel deserves zero stars but yelp won't allow me to give it a proper rating.   First of all, it's not worth anywhere near what they charge for a room, this is not a five-star hotel, period.  The bathtub was dirty, the carpet was dirty, the glassware was dirty, and the furniture was disgusting.   Got back to the hotel on Friday night around 11:30pm and decided to look in the directory book found on the desk in the room only to find a folded up piece of paper with a mound of cocaine still in it from the  previous guests. Most people staying at this hotel would have considered this a bonus but I've been sober for 6 years and wasn't thrilled finding cocaine in our wrap-around terrace ""suite"" to say the least. I called down to speak with the manager, Caleb, and he sent security up to deal with the situation. Security interrogated my girlfriend and I about the matter like we were at fault for the cocaine being left in our ""suite"". They made me fill out a report, which I doubt ever made it to a file for the hotel and then proceeded to say they would flush the drugs, which we never saw them do, they just left with the cocaine. The night manager wouldn't comp us the night and only gave us a $300 credit. They finally moved us rooms, which happened to be in the adjacent tower, mind you it was 2am at this point and we were dead tired. He was almost patronizing us through the process like we were idiots for turning in illegal drugs found in our room. We switched rooms and the people next door were yelling/screaming the entire night along with slamming their door repeatedly. After a sleepless first night we left in the morning after speaking with the day-time manager, who handled things much better than the night manager. The day-time manager was extremely apologetic and was happy to do anything to make our experience with the hotel a better one.   We left and went to The Wynn, which by the way is the nicest and cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The Wynn saved our relaxing Valentines weekend together. The Wynn offers exactly what would I expect from a five-star hotel.   The Cosmopolitan is the worst hotel experience I have ever had and I wouldn't stay there again even if it was free."

""F*ck it.  Coffee shop it is""  Ok... We ate at the Coffee shop 3x while we were in Vegas for the weekend.  Not because it was good, but because we had no choice...  They trick you with convenience... This place is open 24 hr and is located right next to the elevators.  Service is bad, the food is bad and overpriced!!!  Can we PLEASE remember to get food before we come back to the hotel next time?!?! This place is so not worth going to.  With the amount you spend here, you can get better food elsewhere. Here's a good example: Their spaghetti with meatballs is like $18 and it tastes like chef boyardee spaghetti with meatballs http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rLhc543pshadqbfgelyHiw/l (which you can get for $1 a can when you buy 10 at Ralphs) UGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  *edit* NO THERE WERE NO OTHER OPTIONS I SWEAR!"

The bathroom had cracked grout with mildew in spots. This was also the first room I ever rented that came with ear plugs. The room is right next to the Fremont Experience and a Live Stage that went on until after 2 am. Plus the non-smoking room smelt like someone was smoking in the room the whole time. I would get a whiff of smoke every now and then. I was suckered in to getting the room by an agent from Expedia. I will never stay there again, it was awful."

The restaurants (you have to go to STK - see my review) are amazing, the clubs (do what you have to do to get into the Marquee) are insane, and the gorgeous people are, well, gorgeous.  The sheer amount of hot women that walk through this hotel/casino is ridiculous.  Every where you turn there is another one.  I give it 4 stars because I've never actually stayed in one of their rooms.  So i cant give it 5 stars.  but if their rooms and room service are anything like their eateries, clubs, and clientele, then I'm sure this place would get a 5 star rating!  Did I mention the plethora of hot women?!?!?  You gotta check out the giant chandelier.  when i say giant, i mean GIANT!.  it takes up almost the entire side of the floor.  you can actually hang out in it and order a drink in the bar that is in the chandelier.  its hard to explain, trust me, just go."

7828,train,-1,"It pains me to write such a bad review, because I had very high hopes for this hotel. I was in Vegas with a group of friends celebrating a promotion. We thought The Cosmopolitan would be a fun place to stay, given the word of mouth we heard before coming.   Unfortunately we had a terrible experience and I strongly suggest that you and your group does not make the same mistake we did.   I'll start with the biggest problem... safety. We spent the day at the pool, and on the way back up to the hotel, the elevator broke. We were trapped for 2 hours. With 20 people. Including a pregnant woman. It was a miserable experience to say the least. To make it worse, the hotel did absolutely nothing to try to make the experience better. Not even an apology or complimentary meal. The whole situation was handled poorly, and it left a bad taste in all of our mouths.   There were lots of other little things that we did not like, for the price we paid. General clenliness... unfriendly staff... tacky decor. Add it all up, and I would never refer a friend or colleague to this hotel.  I strongly recommend you stay away and book at a hotel that has its act together."

Maybe because he was a tall, heavy built, dark skinned,  Latino man with a full long beard, that looks middle eastern actually....  Shall I say discrimination?"
2123,train,1,"Loved the main areas, wasn't thrilled with the room.  I hate a love/hate stay, mostly love, but I wondered why there was a disconnect.  The hotel is a vibrant, beautifully decorated, modern hot spot.  My room was kind of dirty, missing a bathroom doorknob, and blah compared to the rest of the hotel.  I loved the common areas like the lobby bars and conference rooms.  I loved the bigger health club with the boxing ring and state of the art equipment.  I loved the free pools and had great times there.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the Marquee nightclub and dayclub.  After a lot of hype, it was a big letdown and I stayed less than 1/2 hour in both.  I was not thrilled with the food choices in the hotel, and the retail selection was strange, but it was overall a very good hotel to stay in and I'm glad I did."

After a very stressful 6 hour drive to Toronto I arrived at the hotel only to discover that the card I used to book the trip would not be accepted. I was told that the hotel does not accept visa debit cards and asked why I wasn't told that when I made the reservation I was told that the booking confirmation says the location does not accept cash. I mentioned that does not preclude a visa debit card or even a regular debit card which I also offered I was told they are the same as cash which is not specified anywhere. I offered to pay a deposit or make some other arrangement I was told in no uncertain terms by the extremely rude manager that I would not be staying there that night without a credit card which I did not have available. I was even told that some managers overlook this policy but that this one would not despite my reservation and lack of place to go. Overall this was the worst travel experience of my life, I ended up finding a much nicer hotel with caring staff for a comparable price. If you are considering a trip to Toronto do not stay at this hotel, they may not even let you if you want to."

Inconsistent customer service when guests trying to book - some employees could find our block of reserved rooms, others couldn't for some reason.   Very poor layout of the suite.  Wall when you walk in had a hole cut out of the wall because the front door was too big for the space and they needed to cut out a hole so that you can physically open the door. Unfinished bathroom taps/shower heads.  No conditioner, only shampoo.    Suite had no kitchenette however smaller rooms did. Hallways were not in good condition either - scuffed dirty walls.  Front desk service was not as friendly and willing to help that would be expected with a four-star hospitality rating.  Had to beg to get a corkscrew to the room (none provided).  Overall, the issues weren't catastrophic, however for a 4-5 star hotel the service was very sub-par and quality of the room we had was not up to par."

Everything was going well until we went to get ice and the machine was broke ! It was making noises but nothing came out. This is a a big hotel and we were on the 54th floor! I was annoyed at the thought of  having to walk to another floor just to get ice all day or have to go all the way down stairs to do anything at all! I asked a worker who was in the hall and he said he would send someone up and nothing happened. An hour later we went out to go get something to eat and I seen another  man named Cliff, who appeared to be working .We asked him about the machine and mentioned it to him, he was very nice. He informed us that he would check on that for us.  When we came  back to our room we heard a knock on the door , not even five minutes after we arrived , Cliff brought us buckets of ice! He said that he would be at work on that floor for a few more hours and just poke our heads out and call for  him and he would get us more! Cliff is the man and definitely made our stay way more personable and pleasant!"

Here goes:  To start our cross country trip from California to South Carolina, my husband and I wanted to start our trip in style and not only celebrate our big 3000+ mile journey but also my husbands 50th B-day so, I booked our 2 night stay at the Four seasons. When I made the reservations, I mentioned that this was a celebration and the representative told me she would make sure and have a little surprise awaiting my hubby upon arrival.  Being an experienced Las Vegas traveler, but never staying at the Four seasons I was very excited and hoping not to be disappointed. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the valet who sweeped us away, took our bags, gave us water and showed us to our NO LINE waiting check-in area. The entrance of this hotel is beautiful, clean and classy. Check-in was a breeze. When arriving at our room, which was a suite, let me just say this was the most amazing, beautiful room I have ever seen let alone stayed in, in Las Vegas. The furnishings, the fabrics, the colors, amenities, bathroom toiletries, etc etc amazing. There is nothing left untouched in luxury here. There was even a K-cup machine in our room with free k-cups daily...seriously? LOVE IT! so, our little suprise arrived shortly after check-in and it was a beautiful plate adorned with a luscious slice of cake that looked too pretty to eat. Also, for ""liking"" their Facebook page, I also received another chocolate treat. The desserts were delish and well presented.  The room easily accomodated visiting with my family who lives in LV in the living room area as it had a lovely couch, 2 chairs, a large TV and a view to make most people swoon. This room BTW was the 1 bedroom suite, sorry don't remember exactly the name but I think that was it.  We enjoyed Charlie Palmers one evening and followed our meal with the Michael Jackson Cirque show...AMAZING. Everything was simply top notch. The cafe for breakfast was great. The coffee was some of the best I have ever enjoyed and the service equally impressive. Also enjoyed a drink at the bar one evening which was during happy hour and it was handcrafted nicely and reasonably priced.   The pool is cozy, private and well maintained. I didn't see any of the treats being circulated that they advertise such as fruit etc, but they do offer chilled water at your lounge area and the attendants are quick to get your towels and daybeds ready for you to be as lazy as you like.  Check-out was smooth, quick and painless.........I wish I could say the same for our remainder of hotels along our 2500+ miles from there ...LOL"
2591,train,-1,"I normally don't write a review unless I'm really satisfied or really unsatisfied with my experience.   We need a place to live on the same day so I booked this hotel through Priceline express deal. When I'm at front desk to check in they told me I need to add another $20 if I want to have a double bed room rather than a default king bed room because I got the deal from Priceline. Usually hotels will offer double bed room as long as it is available.  The valet parking is $30 which is really expensive. The self parking nearby is $6 from 4pm-4am and $18 for 2-12hrs since 4am. There are few street parkings but no parking 7-9am weekdays. So even if you arrive at night it would be $24/day for garage parking.  The room itself is not very spacious. There is NO refrigerator in the room, however there are bugs in the room. There are no glasses for teeth brushing and only 1 soap for both hand washing and bath. The tea bags in room look really old. Only 1 facial towel on a 2-towel rack. Bath towels are spotty.   I'm an att user and the signal in the room is really weak!!   I would rather recommend the Renaissance nearby! With about $10 more /day (hotel+self parking), you could receive a much better 4.5 star experience!!!"

The hostess had us waiting in line for 15-20 mins, when we pointed out 6-7 different free tables throughout the restaurant, she told us those tables didn't have a waitress, then ultimately seated us and the next few people at those same tables. Needless to say the service was slow and BAD, the food took FOREVER, we got our burgers BEFORE we got our wing appetizers, and the waitresses had no interest in their job. Management really needs to evaluate the hostess and serving staff, and offer some type of customer service training."

I was not able to partake in being a hotel guest this time around.  The atmosphere feels very posh and high end.  And whoever designed those chandeliers probably doesn't have to dust them, that looks like a full time job.  I can picture their business card now, ""Cosmopolitan Chandelier Cleaner and Expert"".    A bunch of great bars inside and the Wicked Spoon Buffet is here as well, albeit a bit of a trek to get to, that was like a maze.  I felt like people were watching us and laughing as we had to back track multiple times.    Casino offers lots of slot variety and although I played I did not win big.    I would recommend the Cosmo to the younger and more youthful crowd as this seems to offer the backdrop for a fun packed evening."
1727,train,0,"Stayed here bc we got hooked up from my cousin's in-laws.  We booked 2 2-bedroom units to accomodate 10 total.  Each unit had one king, 2 twins, and a fold out queen in the living room.  Spacious enough for us, well-stocked kitchenette, and grill on the patio.    The major downside of this Wyndham is the location.  This place is way off the strip.  They try to compensate this w/ complimentary shuttles that run twice an hour to the strip.  The drop-off is at Caesar's, which is cool.  Uncool is the fact that you can't bring any containers into this shuttle.  How am I supposed to get my pre-drank on?   Wyndham Worldmark also has a complimentary shuttle that brings you to the grocery store around 10am, and stays there for about an hour.  That was nice.  Another plus is being able to mention you are staying at Wyndham and took the shuttle to get there gives you a tiny discount at the checkstand.  Holla!  If you're not too worried about location, then this place is ideal."
325,train,1,"I have visited the grounds on about a dzn occasions.  They really offer alot to locals, (moi).  {See Jaqequeline H. rvw which goes into depth of happy hours, ect}.  FINALLY stayed here last wknd.  Summer rates are $125 with a $50 resort credit (quickly used on the Thursday Spa Special: Martini, Manicure, Hair Wash, Set & Styled $40).  Kids Club is awesome.  Borrow the bikes and ride around the property to get a good look at it, otherwise it's ALOT of walking.  (and you should see it all!  beautiful).  I think i had the room with the BESTEST view!  (pic on their brochures, actually).    Service at front desk prompt, efficient, curitous & professional.  (for some reason, I had a bottle of champange & chocolate covered strawberries in my room?!  YUM :-)  i took it and didnt' dare ask any questions!  lol  Fitness facilities amazing.    Luv the reasonable Crave Cafe for quick munchies, breakfast, bottles of wine, doggie treats.  The only problem I had was the hidden cost of a $25 resort fee which was tacked on and never indicated anywhere at any time to me apon booking, checking in - just appeared on my bill -  Grrrrr."
1025,train,0,"After a night out in Vegas, the last thing you want to do is travel far to find breakfast so you make your way downstairs and voila! The Coffee Shop greets you near the base of the T.I. elevators. I never expect great things out of the casino's cafe but it usually does enough to hit the spot. The Coffee Shop lived up to my expectation and neither impressed nor irritated me.   I ended up deciding that a sandwich sounded more appealing than breakfast since it was after noon by the time we stumbled downstairs. I chose the French dip with a side of fries. The sandwich was good but not the best I've ever had. I asked for a side of ranch and our wonderful waiter, whose name I meant to remember but have now forgotten, brought me a huge bowl of ranch. He knows the way to my ranch-loving heart!   My friends ordered an assortment of breakfast and lunch items. I heard that the omelette wasn't great but the oatmeal was pretty good. Our waiter further impressed us by offering to split the bill five ways, which made our lives much easier.   At $21 with tax and tip, it's way more than I think the sandwich was worth but I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas for convenience."
8736,train,1,"Stayed here for a couple of days.  The suites are well appointed with a sofa-bed, small kitchenette, and a King Bed.  The property is kind of dated, but they've kept up with the maintenance of it.  Everyone from the front desk clerk to the staff at the sports bar are very friendly.  I especially like the proximity to Old Scottsdale (a mile or so) and shopping on Scottsdale Road (a couple of blocks).  The bed is pretty comfortable....not the best I've ever slept in, but very good.  You can find some great rates here too....I agree with what Yelper Karri G said about it being a gem.  I recommend friends to give this place a try.  Return Factor - 80%"
6992,test,1,"Ahhh, my first LEGAL trip to Las Vegas.   The Cosmopolitan was an eye-popping, friendly, technology-filled hotel littered with astonishing sights. I talked to MANY workers, all of whom were willing to answer my questions.   I stayed here with some friends from Dec. 17-19 (Sat-Mon) using the Ellen Degeneres package (free two night stay for ""two"", $500 restaurant credit, $300 spa credit, $60 Marquee credit) I received a year earlier at one of her Christmas shows. The hotel staff had no trouble checking me in/out, as they seemed to know everything about the package.   The hotel room was clean with nothing wrong with it (except for the tiny crack in one of the vanity mirrors). However, our air conditioning did seem to have a little malfunction as we would set it to 65 degrees F and it would change to 70 by itself. The pillows and the bed were extremely comfortable, and I loved the fact that I could adjust the lighting in the room using the television and telephone.   No hidden fees, but be sure to leave the snacks alone because they're placed on a weighted tray.  We also ate at D.O.C.G. and China Poblano - please refer to my reviews of these restaurants.   I will most likely come back to this hotel in the future!!"

It use to be one of my favorite local places to hangout and grab a bite to eat or drink.....now, it's just a shell of it's former self and dirty.  The clientele has declined as well.....I wasn't feeling to safe leaving the casino at 11 o'clock at night.  I only come here now to see a concert.  They occasionally get some good, talented performers in their small showroom....which is what kept me from giving them 2 Stars.  In the past I've seen Ottmar Liebert perform in that showroom.....to see him up close and personal like that was amazing.  Will I return?  Only if they book a good act."
7235,train,1,"Stayed here for 3 nights the week before christmas. My girlfriend always wanted to stay here but the prices per night were always too high. Luckily we saw they had a black friday deal where each night was 50% off. We booked the terrace one bedroom. We checked into the hotel around 9am. Check in is not till 3pm but for $50 you can check in early at 11am. We were going to do that since we were exhausted from our flight but the hotel clerk informed us we could upgrade us to a terrace suite for $50 and the room was available right now. So we chose the upgrade since it was the same price. I definitely recommend getting the terrace suite. We were not disappointed at all. We had two full bathrooms to get ready in, a kitchen with a upgraded fridge. the average fridges have a mini bar which are sensored and a small freezer you can use. Our fridge had the same mini bar but also an empty shelf above it and empty door shelves along with 2 freezers. It also had a microwave, oven and dishwasher. The dishwasher was locked but there aren't any dishes in the room so it didn't matter. We got a fountain view with a balcony that can be accessed from the living room or bedroom. They have automatic dimming light switches so when you get into your room hit the ""welcome"" button and all the lights turn on. When you leave hit the ""goodbye"" and they all turn off. We stayed in the west tower which is a further walk to the strip but it really isn't an issue. Get off at floor 1 and walk through the casino or floor 2 if you want to walk across the street to planet hollywood. Everything in the hotel is very upscaled and chic. Overall the hotel was nice and our stay was amazing. Will definitely stay here again only if we get the 50% off price."
6833,train,1,"The Cosmopolitan is geared towards young people, so it was the perfect choice for us as college seniors on spring break! We were upgraded for $50/night to a one-bedroom suite with a terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains and Paris Las Vegas. Gorgeous suite with a huge living room and bathroom.   The Wicked Spoon was fantastic for brunch. Few of us paid for drinks, but we were all served unlimited mimosas, champagne, and bloody marys. Both the Chandelier Bar and Bond Bar were beautiful. The theme of the hotel is basically pink and sparkly, which is exactly what I love. Each drink cost between $13-17, so pretty expensive. We also got drinks IN the jacuzzi by the Boulevard Pool!  Since we were hotel guests, we were able to skip the line and get in for free at the Marquee! The best part was the huge patio/pool area which gives you a nice break from the cramped dance floor.   The one thing they really need to work on is service in the hotel rooms. Losing 1 star because the mattress in the pull out bed smelled of urine and we weren't able to get anyone's attention that night even though we were told continuously that someone had been sent to take a look at it. They did give us a new mattress the next day, so it wasn't too awful."
241,train,-1,This place sucks. I wish I read yelp before coming here. Stayed Monday and Tuesday nights. People roaming the hall. LOUD. They don't belong here. Loud men and women. Obvious drugs and prostitution happening here. If you drive around the property your gut tells you not to stay here. It's a turd of a property with a fresh coat of paint. I can accept cheap prices as long as I feel safe. I don't feel safe here.
6971,test,0,"Being chic can be elegant. However, being chic can also be tacky. But being simply elegant can be eternally beautiful. Unfortunately, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is of the middle. We stayed here for our best friend's bachelor party. Upon entering the lobby, you are greeted with tall pillars of flat screen TV that boasts different wallpaper designs thought the day. Okay, that is pretty cool. Upon entering our City Room, the 'chicness' abound every facet of the room. The flat screen TV is surrounded by a circular raised panel, odd wall paper designs, a peeping tom shower, and so on...  Okay first things first: one of the sink is clogged, and both bedside lamps aren't working. Not too good for a fairly new hotel. Also the hi-tech switches stopped when you get to the loo where you get a tradition light switch. For me that shouts aloud for being discontinuous.   Being chic is that main theme of Cosmo. But in my humble opinion, their chicness is very convoluted and disjointed. Their theme may be hip to most in 2014 but would it still fly in 2024? I would think they would have to continually renovate to keep up with the latest trends. Whereas Bellagio, Encore, or Palazzo for example, are simply elegant.  All they have to do is continue upkeep and they will remain beautiful, as aforementioned.   However, The Cosmo being at the heart of the strip, is undeniable. Plus the fact that they have the most awesome valet service and crew, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas evens out at 3 stars."
2746,train,1,"For sheer cool factor, this place is the best property on the strip. Service is impeccable. I liked the art books in the room and particularly enjoyed the selection of colored pencils. But what makes this hotel worth staying, and why I'm telling everyone to visit, is the terrace. Our spacious terrace overlooked the north strip and the Bellagio Fountains. We had outdoor furniture on which to relax and enjoy the incredible, mind-blowing views.  Three of the best bars on the strip are located in this hotel as well: Bond, Chandelier and Vesper. Stay here. Worth it."
5943,train,1,We had an awesome stay. We checked quite late at night and our room wasn't available which was a suite. We ended up getting upgraded to an 1800 sq ft suite. We had way too much space. We could run laps lol. The buffet was fresh and tasty and super reasonably well prices. The ice skating rink on the roof with snow showers was unbelievable!! Will be going back for another stay in 3 months.
6036,train,1,"Beautiful casino, especially their Chandelier bar as their centerpiece.  A must to grab a (questionably overpriced) drink.  Their signature nightclub Marquee is definitely worth a visit if you're comped or have the money to burn.  Plenty of spaces to explores and get lost in."
6508,train,0,"I decided to come and stay here for the Halloween week-end, I like to stay in a different place each time.  The room was great overall but the lighting fixtures had minds of their own switching on and off. The top floors of the hotel only has a bank of 6 elevators for floors 47-61. This was a bad move when they built this property I never have had to wait sooo long for the elevators.  One more day/nite here but will not return, new place!!! Maybe the Wynn Looks amazing!!  Cheers"
3956,train,1,"This was the perfect choice for a hotel in Las Vegas.  A refuge in the tacky jungle called Las Vegas, every time we came back to the Four Seasons from time spent on the strip, we gave a huge sigh of relief.  The quiet elegance of the Four Seasons is in such contrast to the glitz and ersatz glamour of the rest of Las Vegas.  This is a perfect hostelry.   Las Vegas is no longer the ""Rat Pack's"" city.  It has been taken over by the lowest common denominator of the nouveau riche.  I'm not as wealthy as many of the people who visit this city, but I have so much more class and carry myself with decorum.  Las Vegas has become very rough around the edges.  The Four Seasons provided us a welcoming cocoon that felt so protective.  Service was genteel and elegant.  Our room with a view of the strip was very comfortable, with an old school sophistication, but providing all the necessary modern necessities.  Bathrooms are large, with thick towels, and are just wonderful.    Again, the Four Seasons was the perfect hotel.  We probably will never return to Las Vegas, unless it has a return to its hey day of being a city of cool and smooth.  Right now Las Vegas is pure honky tonk.  However, in spite of the city being at its very nadir, the Four Seasons Las Vegas Hotel is at its pinnacle."
8899,train,1,"I am surprised to say that this place pleased me. When my cousin booked it recently for our girls Vegas trip & none of us had heard of it & seen that it was 13 miles off the strip we weren't that excited BUT it was one of the best stays I've had. Clean rooms, comfy beds, $2 breakfast meals, $2 margaritas, $8 buffet (sign up for players club card), friendly service from check in until check out. We all agree that we'd stay again in the future."
8012,train,1,"I had a really good experience here.  I came with my friend and her sister to celebrate her birthday and stayed for two nights over President's Day weekend.  I was a little concerned about our stay here after reading some negative comments about the service and the crowd staying here, but I shouldn't have worried - we didn't run into any noise from the club or its patrons, and the service was fantastic.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and balloons for my friend and it was there waiting for us after we came back from our show the first night.  So cute!  The decor is really fun, the beds were comfy (and had NO BEDBUGS, YAYYYYY!!!), the staff were friendly, and the hotel is clean and attractive.  I'm not giving it five stars because nothing happened that absolutely blew me away, but I liked the Cosmopolitan a lot and wouldn't hesitate to come back on my next visit.  Side note: the Wicked Spoon buffet and Scarpetta, the Italian restaurant, were both absolutely fantastic.  Even if you're not staying here, definitely check them out."
4779,train,1,"The restaurants in this hotel are totally amazing.  As for the hotel lobby/casino/public walkways decor and stuff, this place is a bit too sterile and picture-perfect. Well strategized to catch the eye of those looking for perfectly wrapped packages with no trace of human input or creativity, for sure -- but is that not what Las Vegas is all about anyways?"
8131,train,0,"I am a Marriott Platinum member. I've stayed at the Cosmo four (4) times over the past 3 years. I can say the service offerings have gone down ever since they were acquired by Blackstone Group just over 1 year ago. Here's why:  For 3 night stay... Then: 135,000 points + 2 complementary break buffet cards at Wicked Spoon + Nothing out of pocket Now: 165,000 points + $100 out of pocket  Marquee Nightclub... Then: No bullshit at the door Now: Bullshit at the door  Also, coffee within the hotel costs $4 and the concierge only offers it until Noon every day, when they will take it away. You also have to ask for water bottles. ... The Internet sign-on page wasn't working, they offered me NOTHING in return for the hassle. Pricing at Wicked Spoon also went considerably up and breakfast buffet was not as good.  I get the sense that new management is desperately trying to milk out as much money as possible from their customer. They are extremely stingy with everything now."

2212,train,-1,"I stay at Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express hotels a lot for work, so I've sampled what this chain of hotels has to offer.  While there was nothing exactly wrong with this hotel, I wouldn't choose to stay here again if in the area for a few reasons:  - The hotel is laid out so that some of the rooms do not have an outside window and instead overlook the ""courtyard,"" where the pool is.  I think this layout also increases noise in the hallways.  We were awoken on both days by people walking by/talking outside of our room.  - The pool is open in the middle of the hotel, so the whole place sort of smells like chlorine.   - The building itself/the rooms are not that new and seemingly haven't been renovated in a long time.  The bathrooms are cramped and a there was what looked like water damage on the ceiling of our bathroom.  - I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but I didn't get anything special for being an priority club member.  I travel a lot for a work, so I appreciate it when you throw a free bottle of water or snack my way.  - There only shampoo in our room was an almost empty bottle (though the front desk did quickly get me more shampoo).  I also found an old pair of pants someone had left behind the luggage rack in our room.  All that said there are some good points and reasons you might want to stay here:  - The beds are actually quite comfortable and up to Holiday Inn standards.    - It is, in fact, very close to Crocker Park, if that's something you're interested in.  - It's right off the interstate and very easy to get to.  - Parking is plentiful and easy.  - There is free interent.  The two star review reflects these traits and the fact that I value a few things highly that were lacking, but I don't think this is a horrible place to stay.  It was mostly very clean (except those mystery pants in our room...) and the beds were very comfortable."
5071,train,-1,"Dear Hooters Las Vegas,  I have always enjoyed my stays at Hooters Las Vegas. Unfortunately that was not the case this weekend. I checked into the hotel on December 5th and was given room 263 in the Bungalow tower. The room was nice as I expected. The next morning on Saturday December 6, my boyfriend and I noticed the hot water was not working in the shower. I called the front desk and they said they would send somebody right away. After waiting half an hour nobody had arrived. I went ahead and left the room and went to the front desk where a gentleman named Marco assisted me. Marco said that he would give us a separate room to shower in. He offered room 448 in the OCEAN tower. I thought that it was completely ridiculous to walk all the way across the casino and take an elevator just to shower. When I complained they said we could just keep the  ocean tower room to stay. (Why did they not offer that in the first place?) the manager also reversed my resort fee which was very appreciated.   After packing up all our stuff we switched rooms at about 12pm. We left the room for the day to visit the strip. We came back to the room at about 530 pm and took a nap. At about 820pm my boyfriend woke up to take a shower. As he closed the bathroom door I HEAR THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM  OPEN. Keep in mind I am in a t-shirt and underwear laying on the bed! I look up and see a glimpse of somebody walking away quickly and closing the door. Confused I call my boyfriend asking if he left the room and he said no that he was still in the shower. I was completely frightened because someone was able TO OPEN MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR AND WALK IN.  About 5 minutes later someone starts to furiously knock on our door, I open it and a lady in a blue shirt and a man in a black jacket/maroon shirt start questioning me. They state I was supposed to check out today and should not be in the room. When I explain the situation about switching rooms they ask to see my ID. When they check my ID they said thank you and did not even apologize. After a few minutes I walk down to the front desk asking why someone opened my room door without knocking, the manager named ""H"" (who was also the lady in the blue shirt who checked my ID) denied that anyone opened the door before they knocked. I was extremely upset at this because I know what I saw and heard. She completely denied that anybody opened the door without permission. I am extremely upset at this situation as hooters violated my privacy and also did not take the liberty to update their system to acknowledge my new hotel room. I would like a refund for my weekend."
3233,test,-1,"Positives: Room is clean and not smelly. Wi-fi is free & fast. Free breakfast is decent. Negatives: Lousy sound proofing.

839,train,1,"Well, this place wins for location alone.  Now that I'm too old to A) know anyone on campus and B) be fine with couch crashing in rooms with beer soaked carpets, I'm super glad Marriott is here. Now, I'm kind of sad that they ate up the parking lot of our old stomping grounds Legends, but I'm definitely glad we can stay next door to it.  A bunch of us got rooms for our 10-year reunion here over summer, so availability and noise issues may change. They messed up a couple of our friends' room requests, but otherwise it worked out fine. We were able to check in early, and parking was cheap and hassle-free.  The rooms themselves were spacious and it was nice to have full fridges to keep leftovers in (and I suppose drinks, but we're on campus as alumni, no need to really pre-game). Free wi-fi and lots of USB charging ports, too.  The biggest minus I'll give is that the breakfast was pretty disappointing. I had like, a banana, a muffin, and half a bagel? Fine for a quick morning snack, but now how you'd battle off multiple pickleback shots the night before.  Regardless, this is absolutely the place I'm going to stay at anytime I come back down. Any alumni visiting should consider the same."
1752,train,-1,This place is pretty bad. We booked a room on the 5th floor. The hallways smelled disgusting. And there was a bunch of garbage on the floor. It looked like they hadn't vacuumed in about a month. So we got in the room and noticed the same gross stench that was in the hallway.
3452,train,-1,"We were there the first weekend that they transitioned to ""Westin Lake Las Vegas"" The Westin Lake Las Vegas is for one group of people. You are in this group if you have the following: -kids -love of water -love of the outside -doesn't do anything in the room but sleep As long as you meet all of those requirements, then this resort is for you. If it rains, like it did on the second day of our trip, then you are screwed. There is nothing to do besides the pools and lake and the activities on the lake. Luckily, the Las Vegas strip is 30 minutes away, so we ditched the good ole soggy lake and hit the casino.  Now I am not the type to stay away from the room. I want my room to have a garden bath tub, a view and lots of space. The Westin is none of these. Our room was small, dark, dirty and old. And we paid extra to have this room. Yeah.....like I said we ditched it after 1 night.....not just because of the rain. There were so many mosquitoes in the room that I had to stand on the bed with a wad of toilet paper and kill them. I didn't succeed in getting all of them which resulted in many bites in the morning. The rooms should come with a mosquito net. Also, I'm only 5'6....I shouldn't be able to stand on a full bed and reach the ceiling...but I guess I didn't mention the drop ceiling in our tiny room. The lake and the activities are nice, I would have liked to take the kids down to the lake for the fire and s'mores, but it's not worth the dirty room. I would rather stay in a tent."
8992,train,0,"I was with a sports team, so I didn't actually have to check-in. (our team president checked us in). The people in the front desk were very nice and helpful. We exchanged currency from them multiple times. I also called front desk for more towels a couple of times and a few minutes later, I got towels. Pretty good service here.  Rooms. They are kinda small. Well smaller than I imagined, but I guess it's average size. The ventilation in the room was not that great. They don't have a central air system, so the A/C unit was low to the ground, which doesn't do much if it's down there. It looked clean overall. House keeping came in and remade the beds, etc.  I slept alright. It's a pretty average hotel."

Upside: Great room, service, bars/lounge, club, casino, restaurants and location.  Downside: Very pricey to gamble and very else within the hotel.  Note: 3 Nights stay from Fri thru Sun can easily run you up to about $1500"
8877,train,1,I highly recommend this hotel. I had a TERRIBLE experience with super 8 across the street the night before and Brittney at the front desk at this hotel was amazing! Front desk people like her that actually care make the stay so much better! And for the same price as the super 8 this hotel was so much better! Oh and the free morning breakfast is good!
9458,train,1,"Love the rooms and amenities as well as service at the Marriott. The staff at the front desk are not the friendliest, but I give kudos to Abby Duffey and Adam Riegler. I have never worked with such a great sales executive and room controller. Without their help and efforts, our team would not have had such a great time in Cleveland.   The rooms are well-managed and kempt, and the concierge lounge offers a variety of snacks and food. However,the gym is disappointing.   I'm an SPG loyalist, but I must admit that I enjoyed my stay the Marriott here and would not mind visiting, again, if I were to return to Cleveland. Moreover, the location makes exploring convenient as it is situated in the heart of downtown."

The best part of the room was the balcony, no one else has had this and it was great! I was in room 5104, and it did not face the Bellagio fountains, but it had sun, and was warm and comfortable in 55 degree weather.  I never waited for service at the restaurants, and by the way, best pizza for lunch in Las Vegas! Staff was very helpful and friendly, and the dealers at the tables were great!

Breakfast was full cooked Scottish buffet, although the queue for the ancient toast machine was long - the addition of a still maid for tea and toast to the table would have been welcome.

My favorite part is that the rooms have a balcony, and if you're lucky, you get a room facing the Bellagio fountains!! The view is beautiful during the day and at night!  The only thing is that I feel like all the rooms are centered around the shower. It's designed for a couple, cause the showers are very open and have windows that look into the bedroom or the balcony. It makes sharing a room with friends a little difficult lol. And the bathroom doors don't lock, just FYI.   And check out Secret Pizza and Holsteins while you're there!"
3495,test,-1,"We had out of town family and friends staying at this resort for a celebration. The property is beautiful and the floor plan of the rooms large and comfortable. Bed linens are nice and soft and the bathroom very clean.  But the bugs.... oh my! You know there is a problem when there is a printed insert under the glass on your night table about the resort having pest control regularly,advising you to keep your shoes up on shelves and call the desk about any insects in the room.  There were spiders and crawlies by the door - we realize it is in the desert so no big deal. But when we were awakened at 4am by a BIG brown bug crawling up my husband's arm in bed, now that's a problem. I managed to capture it and we then spent the next ten minutes tearing off the sheets looking for more.  Upon check out I took the critter to the front desk and told them they really needed to step up the pest control. The employee was very nice, she immediately offered to take our lunch meal that was charged to the room off the bill. I thanked her and thought that was the end of it.  A few minutes later I met up with the guests we had in two other rooms I told them how nice the front desk person was. They then shared there own bug problems from the prior night (guessing they did not bring it up prior because we were hosting them there). One room had a HUGE scorpion just inside the door on the rug and another crawling up the wall over the bed. The second room guests had the pleasure of a scorpion in the closet and were greeted in the am with two bugs that landed overnight in their glass of water on the nightstand.  I did call the resort back to let them know and was told they realize it is a problem and were sorry..... Sorry, that's not good enough when six guests in three rooms could not sleep comfortably because of insufficient chalking,weather-striping,pest control, etc.   Now it makes me wonder if there is a problem in the kitchen / restaurant too?

My party walks in and we see a wonderland of shiny, sparkly and blinged out things! from crystal looking low dropped giant chandeliers to shiny mirrored pillars..to modern chic lounges... aaaah. so HIP. so COOL.. so YOUNG!  Save moolah and book a stay here!!!! And worth a visit.....to show off your classy sexy outfits and shoes....  Don't bling yourself out too much though... you'll blend too much with the interior. Stand out and Keep classy!"
1741,train,-1,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom/6 full unit. Not a bad space for family vacation, but it has some downfalls.   You have to pay for Wifi(unless you ask for it free at the front desk). Even then the network isn't secure and not the greatest. Don't plan on making important emails.   The fitness center is small, but on the plus side it never closes.  Bring earplugs if you want to sleep, or you will be hearing the traffic from the highway all night. Not a bad experience but I wouldn't stay here again."
1128,train,1,"Really nice, upscale hotel.  My family and I have been staying here for years and they never fail to accommodate special requests.  Their staff is courteous and professional and the grounds and rooms are impeccable.  Stayed this last weekend and had a blast watching the final four in the Agave.  Highly recommended!"
7787,train,1,We didn't stay here but went to the pool parties and it was awesome.  The hotel looks amazing.  The Day Club was great.  We got a day bed and were able to lounge in the pool.  Can't wait to go back.
7279,train,-1,"Very disappointed.  We checked in and at our time of check were never notified of the Identity Membership program.  We did not find out about it until our last night staying there by someone that gave me change that works in the casino at The Cosmopolitan. We were eating & gambling at the Cosmopolitan & could have been earning points.  I ask to speak to the manager when checking out,  Nhan Phan walks up completely talks over me & tells me it is not the front desk responsibility to inform us of this program , mind you that's not what the lady that signed me up in the casino said.  She was in fact very shocked and mentioned three times that she could not believe we were not offered the program.  Also what I do not understand is if they are not required to tell me about the program then why is it advertised on the back of the room key.  I go to talk to The Identity Program desk after & Tensy informs me that since we booked through Vegas.com we were most likely not going to get points for our stay because it is 3rd party, do you think Nhan Phan told me that... Nope & she asked me who I booked it through & to see my reservation information.  Very upset & disappointed in the way my situation was handled & lack of communication & consistency in how information is provided to guest .   Another disappointment was I opened the door to ask the maid cleaning the room directly across from my room 4911 and she tells me I need to call downstairs .  Mind you she has a cart full of clean linen.  Then another member of housekeeping that is soon going to work on our room ask what I need & she gives me what I need no problem .  Not only that later on that evening a staff member was walking out of what looked like was a linen closet but she wanted me to call downstairs to get a couple of hand towels .  Not good customer service ."
4685,train,1,"Stayed here recently and thought it was good. No problems.  The room was clean and all the staff that we encountered, was very friendly. The coffee and the breakfast bar was decent for the money. For the price, would definitely stay here again."
3235,test,0,"Stayed here the other night and the experience was mediocre at best.   The exterior and interior of the property have been well maintained. Check-in process was very easy since Hilton Honors members have the ability to choose a room online prior to arrival! The check-in agent was friendly too!  Managed to score a corner room, hoping for a quiet evening. The bathroom was in good condition at first glance with great water pressure...however the middle of the shower was sinking in...really bad!  The mattress was a low-end bonnell, inter-connected spring designed for 1 sleeper... It wasn't very good.  Walls were paper thin and I could hear the lyrics of the music that my next door neighbor was playing...not too loud either! ...throughout the night, I heard my neighbor upstairs walking and running the toilet in the morning...eek!  Hot breakfast is typical of Hampton Inns, hot french toast, hot oatmeal, breakfast sausage, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, and juices. ...none of it was appealing by any standards...it's a quick and easy way to not be hungry first thing in the morning! ;)  ~$70/night after tax and tip.  Free Wifi, Free Parking, Free Hot Breakfast, No Resort Fees  Free Coffee & Tea in the lobby all day."
7259,train,1,"The name says it all - this place is cosmopolitan.  I stayed at Wynn last year when I came into town for CES and thought it was fantastic (it still is) but The Cosmopolitan is where I hope to stay the next time I'm in town. For those of you with children, I'd suggest you stick to the theme hotels; The Cosmopolitan is clearly for adults and they don't make any apologies for it.  I was here without my kids but, as a parent, I can't help but see things from that perspective. No, I wouldn't stay here with them.  Check-in was a breeze. The staff was knowledgeable, helpful and they had a good sense of humor - like the laughing when I asked for an upgrade during their busiest week of the year. Hey, it was worth a shot!  The room was spacious and well appointed. It also afforded a terrific view. I don't know how many restaurants are in the complex but I think you can stay there a week and never repeat a meal in the same place.  I did eat at a few and will review them separately."
5204,train,-1,"This is a dirty late night casino right off the Vegas strip across from the MGM. My boyfriend stayed here 8 years ago and raved about how nice it was, within five minutes of being there I heard him saying ""this sure isn't what it used to be!"" I guess it really went downhill. The dealers were very unprofessional, especially at the craps tables. Everything was kind of run down. I went back to the bar to order some famous wings to take back to the hotel so I could get us out of there. The bartenders were as bad as the dealers, I saw my order sitting on the counter for at least 10 minutes before he finally gave them to me and I had already paid. It was irritating! The wings tasted really good and were the only good part of our experience at hooters (probably because we got the wings to go!) Skip this place, there's a ton of other options close by!"
5205,train,-1,"I will not stay here again. it has a cheap motel feel. Queen beds were not Queen, they were actually 2 full size beds. Beds were uncomfortable. feels unkept, filthy,& poorly maintained."
6932,train,-1,"I am torn on how to rate this hotel....  Hotel is gorgeous!! The rooms, pools, casino's and restaurants were beautiful. For the most part the staff was great. However there were a few that were not so great and will make me second guess staying here again.   I am a larger woman and let's just say felt discriminated against a little at the pool area's / restaurants. I shouldn't let a few ignorant people change my experience yet they also need to understand that regardless of appearance, sex, sexual orientation, etc our money spends the same and EVERYONE should be treated equal. If you don't want to do that... you should not be in that line of business.  Side Note;  I emailed the Resport Manager about my negative experience on 07/13 (today is 07/21) and I have yet to receive any kind of response.  I was not looking for any credit or freebies, just acknowledgement of my concerns.   Poor Customer Service Cosmopolitan - So disappointing!"
8290,train,-1,"Considering this place just opened a month ago you would think they would have the cleanest rooms but they don't. Shit all over the floor and boogers on the wall. This was already the 2nd room change so we're stuck. The manager is incompetent, I asked him why there were no bellmen and he said there is only bellmen for people who need help. I guess having 3 large suitcases wasn't enough for assistance. I have nothing good to say about this hotel. The rooms suck, the staff is rude, and it's no where near the strip. I will not be staying here or giving them any more of my money. Oh and another thing I'm not going to say they are racist but the two black groups had an issue"
2624,train,1,"This is my go-to Vegas hotel. Non-gaming makes a huge difference for my sanity in this fun-filled, nightlife city. So nice to not have smokey scent everywhere.   The service is always top-notch from check-in to housekeeping to room service. This is such a clean hotel. They are very accommodating to my health issues - they offered me a Hypoallergenic room, noted that room would not be cleaned with harsh cleaners and room sprays during my stay, and provided me with O2 fragrance-free toiletries. Room service made the oatmeal without dairy for me - so great!  Nice, quiet pool area. Easy access to Mandalay's many pool area. Resort fee also covers bottled water.   Beautifully appointed rooms. Hip decor. Lots of closet space. Nice seating areas.   I wish they would not pump in fragrance (as so many hotels do now, especially in Vegas) on the main floors. Other than that, this is the perfect hotel for me."
1271,train,-1,On today's date we are sitting by the pool trying to enjoy ourselves. It's hard though because the spa is cold and full of leaves. Jumped in the pool to refresh and got more than I bargained for. Pretty Icelandic in there. Water quality seems decent but that's about the best I can do for this place. Rooms were clean can't bitch about that. Jim is also a little bit subpar. Speaking of par frisbee golf around here is phenomenal. We are going to do an afternoon session as soon as we are done trying to enjoy this pool but it's hard to. Also the breakfast is really damn good. They give you one free breakfast though even if you're staying here tonight. Kind of f**** up
2036,train,1,"I'm a fan!  If you want luxury, relaxation and not have to deal with all the drunk people roaming around, come here. Its directly connected to the Mandalay Bay, in fact its right upstairs.  So even though this property does not have a casino, you have easy access to the Mandalay Bay.  Additionally, even though the Four Seasons has a variety of amenities - pool, spa, etc. you have access to all of Mandalay's amenities which includes their wave pool, etc.  I have stayed in the South Side (Palazzo, Venetian), Center (Cosmo, Aria) and the north side, I have had positive experiences staying over here.  If you don't have a car, you can easily walk over to the Luxor and take the tram to get to the other side.    The rooms are spacious, modern and the customer service is superb. They were very accommodating.  If you need a fridge or microwave, you can request it upon arrival. If you need a rollaway bed, its $50.    We got a 1200sq. feet, 1 bedroom suite and it comfortable fit the 6 of us.  I would highly recommend this property."
7598,train,-1,Don't know how this place earned 5 stars especially compared to the competition elsewhere on the strip.  Vegas resident here.  Visited this casino on a slow Sunday night and got worse service than I've had at a Super 8 motel!  Me and my boyfriend sat at a virtually empty sports bar and watched as the bartenders chit chatted with a few other patrons for nearly 10 minutes without acknowledging us.  We got up without being served and chalked it up to a rude server and tried to move on with our evening.  We checked out the nightclub upstairs and we're met with a large mob of people with little semblance of a line or organization.  We quickly realized that there was no point to patiently waiting as people were cutting under the barriers and jumping large chunks of the line to skip ahead.  No security or moderation in sight.  We decided to give this place one last chance and headed down to the lobby bar.  We asked if they had anything on special this evening and the pretentious fellow working the tap rolled his eyes and scoffed at us as if we'd just asked for a comped cuisine!  After informing us there were no specials and that a bud light would run us nearly $9 each we politely declined due to his attitude and headed home for the evening completely empty handed.  If the Cosmopolitan is going to continue to set the bar so low for their service it won't be long before the well runs dry on this establishment.
1401,train,0,"This was the 2nd Strip property coffee shop/cafe I ate at this week. I was with some of my family as we were doing some sightseeing, and we needed some reasonably priced grub. We weren't going to shell out $20 for an entree, and we were pretty hungry so we stopped here. I thought the menu was pretty decent for a cafe/coffee shop, and because it was dinner time, we had our choices of food. I was excited they had a veggie burger, even though I didn't get one. It is hard for me to understand places like this that don't carry veggie burgers, not just vegetarians eat these...anyway...I had the nachos. They were $13 but the plate was massive and there was no way I could have finished these bad boys if it weren't for the others at my table.  Service was pretty decent, we had a couple awkward moments with the server, but its Vegas, so it happens.  If I am in TI and craving food again, this won't be a bad stop."
8168,train,1,"We never knew luxury until we came here. We felt special. The check in guy was soooo nice. The room was sooo nice. And to think that that's the standard room that they have. It was so nice that when we changed hotel and went to MGM suite, it feels like we got downgraded. SADNESS... We miss our COSMOPOLITAN room. We want our 200+ channels, BBC AMERICA, SIRIUS radio. We want our Refrigerator/Freezer (even though we didn't have any drinks to put in at that time), we miss our dishwasher (and we didnt have dishes to wash), we miss our Microwave. The huge shower area and bath tub. And of course, the exhaust fan it the toilet area. Those small nuances that seem to be standard to COSMOPOLITAN is lacking in a MGM suite. Only thing that I might complain with regards to COSMOPOLITAN is they don't have a coffee maker, BF loves his coffee."
3444,train,0,"I live in the Lake Las Vegas area so this review is just for the pool.  I stopped by the pools today with some family to enjoy music, food, and the heat. Overall, we had a great time. The water seemed more cold than normal but it wasn't unbearable, it was actually quite nice paired with the heat today. There was a DJ for the 3 hours I was there and he played music for everyone: rap, hip-hop, country, oldies, etc. I thought that was very considerate of him. We ordered food and the menu seemed cheap also. I ordered chicken tenders with ranch and fries and they were good. I also ordered a bloody mary, mild w the spice, extra olives and extra limes (I know, ""WE GOT A COMPLICATED ORDER!"").  My mom and I are very sensitive to hot sauce, pepper, etc. I think the only down part was our drinks being incredibly spicy, which we watered down significantly, and all the little kids running around. The little kids has nothing to do with the establishment. I'm the eldest of 7 and have not had to deal with little kids for a very long time, I'm just a jerk :).   The water slide is also pretty cool!"
1764,train,-1,"This Hyatt is fairly old compared to others we've been too. The offer the same amenities as other Hyatt places, just in a less appealing way (best way I can word it). We stayed during the 4th of July holiday as we normally stay at Hyatts and I had enough points to comp some of the nights. They were fairly busy, like most of the hotels in Vegas during that holiday. See below for pro's and con's:  Pro's: - free continental breakfast in the morning - free parking - free shuttle to Planet Hollywood (4x a day) - free shuttle to / from the airport  - friendly staff all around  Con's: - pretty old and a bit run down looking - free breakfast is subpar compared to other Hyatts - long walk to the strip if you miss the shuttle  - room layouts are a bit odd - pool is more like you'd find at a motel 8  Overall, the staff here are what made this stay enjoyable. They all were friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was pretty sub average. I'm surprised they don't have a Regency in Vegas with all the work travelers, but I think we'll continue to stay on the strip for any future Vegas trips and avoid this place until they do some renovations."
2332,train,-1,This place is a joke. They have the most ridiculous parking validation process I have ever seen. I attempted to validate my parking at the cage. They told me a floor person needed to do the validating and to hit the service button on a  machine. We did. Waited for 15 minutes at a random machine. Even had security page a floor person. Finally resorted to physically walking and flagging someone down. Then this woman wants to argue w us that she didn't see us playing so she refused to validate even after we explained that we were on the other side of the floor when we played. We did what the cage person said to do. Had to pay for parking. But oh wait I have no more cash. And they don't take credit cards.  So I had to go back in and buy something from subway just to get out of the parking garage. Super pissed I will never spend a penny here again.
1129,train,0,"I've been staying  at this hotel regularly for work since 2013 and always returned because the pool was clean and long enough for me to do laps and the breakfast buffet was a treat with big bowls of fresh berries during the summer. I took a hiatus this winter and and returned in May to find the breakfast buffet has been discontinued for the summer months and the pool water is murky, with a thin veneer of green algae on the bottom. Staff are still very pleasant and the rooms are great in that they have a separate bedroom with French doors separating the living room, full size tub and a separate walk-in shower. All have a coffee maker and mini fridge.  This property is rather secluded; you cannot easily walk to any other eating establishments."
7745,train,-1,"We came to the Cosmo to celebrate my birthday. Dinner was excellent as well as the services at STK. In the near future, I hope that they install real ATMS because the card readers are terrible.   I now understand why there dealers don't have name tags because you cannot file a formal complaint. For a city that's supports entertainment and hospitality services, some dealers HATE there job and just ruin the fun for everyone.   Serious evaluation should be done on all dealers and should be ranked by the customers. If they hate there jobs then they should find work elsewhere. For the good dealers and pit bosses, you guys are awesome, but for those and you know who you are. QUIT your job cause you stink at it and are miserable and bring misery to the hands that feed you.   Unfortunately what should have been a great evening was ruined by a few azzes who hate their jobs and should be terminated.   For that my ranking from this experience should be no stars but YELP won't allow me to do it. The Cosmo doesn't deserve any stars, but STK 5+ stars."
727,train,1,"Beautiful resort with nice rooms. What really made the difference for me was the service. We had some rowdy neighbors and the reception staff made sure we left our stay with them as satisfied guests.   My suggestion (based on my weekend visit): if you are a light sleeper or have a relatively early bedtime, don't book a room next to the main pool. The pool is open until 12am and I'm not sure how it is monitored after that time.    The staff at both the main pool and the adult only pool were very attentive and efficient!   My relaxing weekend would have been perfect had it not been for the inconsiderate guests staying near us at the same time. Nothing the resort can do about that part but overall my experience was fantastic!"
8697,train,1,"To enjoy Spring Break with our son my wife booked us a week  at the Chaparral Suites in Scottsdale. It was love at first site. Seriously this place rocked. If you are looking for marbled floors, stuffy front desk personnel, and overpriced drinks go somewhere else. This place looks like it is fresh off the set from a 70's movie.  However, the included breakfast (cooked fresh to order) is really good. The amenities are great (pools, tennis courts, gym, etc.). The daily happy hour with free drinks is a nice way to wind down the day by the pool. The rooms are suite style and give you lots of comfort away from home. All of this for the daily room price makes this hotel a must stay. I almost don't want to share the secret of how good this place is...  Conveniently located in Scottsdale we were near everything we wanted to do in Arizona for the week. The front desk staff is helpful as is the concierge service. We will definitely go back to stay."
617,train,1,We were trying to figure out how the bus tour worked and where the stops were.  We met a ticket salesman named Brandon at Treasure Island who was so helpful.  We got our tickets and waited and chatted with him about the different stops on the tour.  He was so helpful and knowledgeable about which stops we needed to hop off at to see the sights we wanted to see.  I love it when I come across such helpful service.  Great tour.  Thank you Brandon for all your help!
9403,train,-1,"The servers can have a bit of an attitude and can be rude in the sportsbook area.  I wished they had negative star statutes. Because they deserved it today.  I asked one of the waitresses for a bottle of water, and she told me ""oh you need a drink ticket..."" I'm like FOR WATER?!? She's like ""yeah""... I'm like ok... Nvm.  It's like pulling teeth for ANYTHING UNLESS you are putting money into the casino.  I'm not like everyone else, I know how to maneuver around stuff.  OAN another time I asked the server for a daiquiri and she's like "" oh we don't do daiquiris here..."" REALLY!?! UGHHHH.  this is why I just stick to the 99 cent margaritas at the bar so I can avoid this type of crap.  And the margarita machine wasn't freezing and I didn't want to walk on the other side of the casino to get one."
7617,train,1,If you want to stay connected the Cosmo may not be for you. It's the place to see and be seen. You will have a hard time connecting to the Internet and poor cell reception. (Maybe it's an AT&T thing) With all that said it's a beautiful hotel with all the bells and whistles. Not the best for business but definitely a fun playground!!!  And it's a Marriott!!! More points for me!!!
3646,train,1,I could write a long list of reasons why you should see the show but honestly goes down to these things... the music choice is amazing the girls are beautiful the dances are sexy in the venue is great any seat you'll have a amazing view ....

897,train,1,"My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for the NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day. We spent three nights here and loved it. We had the Mr. Boggs room which faces the street and over looks the park across the street (in the picture, the 3 windows on the second floor are Mr. Boggs room). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The entire Inn was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Karl and Jeff are wonderful hosts. We had made dinner reservations at a local restaurant, but upon arrival at the Inn were told that Jeff prepared a special New Year's eve dinner for the guests. He is a wonderful chef...dinner was delicious. The next morning he prepared a special New Year's Day breakfast of quiche and potatoes, in addition to the cold, every day breakfast items the normally serve. The restaurant is only open for private dinners. I suggest taking bottled water, wine/beer, sodas & snacks with you, as there is nothing ""right there"" to get those types of things. Free parking on the street and easy walk to downtown and Heinz field. Highly recommend!!"
6804,train,1,"Amazing hotel. The room was the nicest room I have ever stayed in. 2 beds, living room kitchen, balcony with a view of the fountains. The stafff, awesome. Whenever we called for something is was in our room quickly. They answered any question we had and were very helpful. The hotel itself is incredibly chic and young. Definitely the 21-35 year old crowd. The only negative was the check in. We checked in at 11 and had to wait around until 4 to get a text that our room was ready. It was not a huge deal since there is so much to do on the strip but I wish we could have went into the room when we arrived. Another thing that might turn some people off is the crowed is a bit of the ""im better than you"" type."
810,train,1,"Wonderful hotel. The room was very pretty, clean and comfortable. It felt like a hotel one would pay more for. The location is great - a block from the metro, a very short walk to the old part of town and definitely far enough away from the sketchy Spectacles area. The staff was very nice and helpful, particularly a young woman named Angela who gave me and my husband many great recommendations.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the breakfast. The bagels and croissants were clearly a cheap frozen variety. Plan to eat out for breakfast and you'll be very pleased with this hotel."
1256,train,1,"We found this by using a search engine (don't recall which). What a fantastic place to stay! We stayed here for 7 days Sept. 2012 and were more than pleased.  The people at the Reception desk were fantastic and very helpful and knowledgeable; getting taxis, giving directions, smiling. The housekeeping staff was great as were the servers in the dining room. It's a bed & breakfast that also serves lunch and dinner, plus has a bar for late night snacks. Breakfast is included in the rate; you pay for lunches and dinners. We ate lots of meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) there; breakfast is kinda typical Scottish (includes tomatoes & beans along with eggs, sausage, bacon plus cereals, yogurt & fruit). Lunch was sandwiches and a few other things. Dinners could be fish/chips or steak or chicken stuffed with haggis, even duck. Internet service only in lobby or bar area, but they also provided a computer by reception. Taxi to Edinburgh City Center was about 10 pounds or so (the streets were torn up; with that & traffic it could vary slightly, but not by too much. We would definitely stay there again!  Stayed September 2012, traveled with family"
1406,train,-1,"This hotel has the potential to be so much better than the experience I had. Its location is prime - sitting in the heart of downtown Toronto. It's right next to the Eaton Centre and is in the vicinity of restaurants that range from diner-status (Fran's) to fancy schmancy (Canoe). Moreover, it may not look like much on the outside but it's lovely on the inside. It's definitely one of the nicer hotels with pretty chandeliers, lighting, and decor. The rooms were designed elegantly, but some of the furniture, like the table looked scraped. The check-in process wasn't welcoming at all. We approached the desk and weren't even greeted. The receptionist treated us with indifference throughout it all. It was an awkward interaction to say the least. We had booked a room with a kitchenette so that we could cook some of our meals. It was perfect and exactly what we wanted. However, the kitchenette wasn't even equipped with the basic necessities. I had called up the front desk for a pot to boil some water, but they informed me they couldn't find any in the other rooms of the hotel. When I tried to insist that there must be at least one, he told me that room service was closed for the night. I think it just goes to show that the hotel may have looked the part, but it didn't measure up in hospitality for a magical experience. Be wary of all the items laid about. Almost all of them have a price-tag attached to them - even the bottles of water."
2876,train,-1,"The price was very reasonable for three nights; thanks to Groupon  BUT the room was horrible.  The water didn't drain during our showers, ankle high water for a 5 min shower. Room service was no where to be found at times, even when we called. Walls super thin. Stains on the rug, holes in bathroom wall. Upgrades def needed.  It is what it is, we went to Vegas for a concert and my birthday so I wasn't planning on being inside of the room most of the time but I def expected more."
