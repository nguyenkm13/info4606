negative,"After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.   My order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not. I went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff. I got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not. I will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!",
negative,"I recently moved to this area and decided to stop at this Fry's on the way home from work...big mistake.  I guess I've been spoiled by the Fry's Marketplace I used to frequent near PV. This store really is not that big and it kinda gave me the creeps. I left with only a quarter of what I needed to buy because they didn't not carry most of the items I typically buy.  I had to wait in line forever as there were only 2 registers open. The cashier was nice but the bagger was too busy talking and not paying attention that he was literally putting one item in each of my bags. I will not return to this Fry's, lesson learned!",
negative,Decent inexpensive Mexican restaurant. Not particularly special. The food was okay and arrived quickly. \nThis place will feed you if you are hungry and don't have a lot of money in your pocket.,
positive,"Taking a girl here will solidify the win. Trust me. And yea, they have drinks.",
positive,Awesome I have to say. My husband and I saw this in March 2013. Loved the baby carriage in the beginning and once the baby came out and started the comedy acts they were messing with a guy in my area as being his Papa!! hilarious.. The d\u00e9cor was beautiful. The costumes were amazing as well as the story line. I loved the guy in the aerial square. So amazing.,
negative,"I visited the Old Town Tortilla factory about five years ago with fond memories so when back in Scottsdale tonight I decided to give it another go. I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, my experience was nothing special. My waiter was friendly enough but the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos. Upon my waiters advice I order the \""sauce\"" on the side because I was concerned about them being too spicy. What I received was three \""chunks of fish\"" on three mini tortillas with four small condiment bowls containing the black beans, jalape\u00f1o sauce, guacamole and a white cucumber sauce? It just looked kinda strange and the fish wasn't all that fresh. I didn't complain because my waiter only asked if I wanted dessert.  Maybe it's me but it just wasn't what I expected. I think there are a lot of other good choices in Scottsdale.",
positive,"Called in a delivery order. Lady was super friendly. Got pizza, garlic knots and Italian salad with house dressing. Everything was delicious. Would order from them again for sure.",
negative,"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels.",
negative,"I was craving ribs and fortunately, my gf was nearby Memphis \""championship\"" BBQ. Note that we been here before and loved the food. so tonight we ordered whole BBQ chicken and full slab of babyback ribs. Ordered 2 Mac n cheeses, fries n hush puppies. Instead they replaced 1 Mac w BBQ beans normally I wouldn't mind but it had an off put taste. I didn't eat it. Mac was like albertsons bought n hush puppies were burnt outside n not cooked thoroughly.  Now the ribs n chicken. Chicken was dry n bland. Ribs were tough, bland, weird color and no BBQ or smoke flavor at all. I doubt that it ever was smoked. Seem like it was either boiled or baked then heat up on the grill when ordered. I'll even put up a $1 it's probably microwaved. We are very disappointed. Leftovers gone straight to trash! Waste of money.",
negative,"I've experienced waayyyyyyy better as a pub downtown. I remember when it opened: it was one of the few spots downtown I liked to go, grab a pint of beer and order some nice pub food on your nice terrasse. Now, not so much.  Let me tell you why in four words: worst customer service ever!  My last two times were awful: we waited too long for our food on lunchtime during a week day last summer; and on another night after a screening at Fantasia, then again a too-long service. And the waiters were rude, you could feel they were rushed to serve too many people at the same time! I could have excused it if it happened only one time, but two in the same month? Nope. I'm a sucker for good service and cool servers/waiters. And I heard friends of mine had the same type of experience at your pub.  So I'm sorry, but you won't see me again in your pub for a damn long time, and I will never recommend your place to my friends when they'll be asking for a pub downtown.",
negative,"The candy here is way overpriced ($12.99 per pound), but I needed a sugar fix. I'd gone a few days without chocolate so I happened to be walking around in The Mirage and wandered to this store. I saw the Britney Spears couture pop advertised in the front and was steering clear of that section. I got a tiny scoop of chocolate covered gummi bears and a few peach flavored gummi penguins. This cost me $3.25 (1/4 lb). Yikes. The selection is the usual gummis that you could buy in a grocery/convenience store for 99 cents a bag. They had a decent variety of chocolate covered items (pretzels, raisins, nuts, coffee beans). Would not go back unless I needed chocolate to survive.  I did notice in the display case and in the back area of the store that they have bra and panty made of candy. Perfect gift for a bachelorette. Those were running $12-$20.",
positive,"I'm not a brunch type of person because I'd rather save my appetite for lunch or dinner. However some of my friends are brunch type people and the last 2 visits to Las Vegas I went here to eat with them. Sometimes I surprise myself for being able to wake up on time for a meal this early in Las Vegas. Might be tricky to find but it's below lobby level of The Venetian. The food here is very good, and the selection of different type of brunch food and pastries is big. Both times that I've been here, we had to order the foie gras spread. So delicious! Corned Beef Hash was what I had and the portions are very big.  Our waitress was friendly and knew the menu very well.",
negative,This place is ok. The food is decent besides the overpriced fajitas that had overcooked meat. The main issue is the terrible service. They argue with you on where you sit and had to ask my waitress to stop grabbing with the hostess to do her job. I am currently trying it again and the waitress is exceptionally impatient and seems to not want to be here at all. The only good experience has been the first time we came here and the manager was fantastic and so was the server. How that has seemed to change. The night crew here is terrible.,
negative,"So one afternoon, stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich. Looked pretty good. I have this weird thing of chopping my subs into one bite sizes, so was doing that as usual.\nafter I have half of my sub, I find a piece of chiken..... pink inside. They served me a half raw chicken sub! I mean, I noticed this cause of my weird hobby of chopping my sandwich but if I didn't, I probably wouldn't of noticed. . .  don't wanna think about that. I went to show them that and, they remade me a new chicken teriyaki sub (which was nice) but. . .  I totally lost my appitite and was scared of imagening finding another half raw chicken in my sandwich. There's other subway's in town so probably go to those, never back to this one.",
positive,"Friendly Donut is another favorite donut shop of locals.  A family friend has been raving about them for years and we finally took her advice. And yes, the donuts were good.  Its tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front. Now on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet. Pick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM/ Banks on Boulder Hwy. Friendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops. Shame on the people who say that Las Vegas has crappy donut shops...here's a tip- you won't find a good donut shop on the LV strip. Look with your mouth not with your eyes. Aloha",
negative,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here to try our luck at the roulette tables here and this place is the worse casino ever to gamble.  When we walked in we noticed that NOBODY was here gambling but that didn't stop us.  We went to a roulette table where it was a $10 minimum and decided to play.  First off the tables seemed filthy and dirty with stains all over like they don't know how to take care of their tables.  My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer on the table and the dealer looked at him with a disgusted look and rolled her eyes at him and off top that was the first negative thing I noticed.  He continued to play at the same table and was standing at the corner of the edge of the table where its hard to reach all the numbers on the other side.  Usually when he can't reach all the numbers he gives his chips to the dealer and tells her which numbers he wants his chips placed (which is NEVER EVER a problem at any other casino but here) and after a couple of times she seemed very snobby and gave him attitude about it.  She actually told my boyfriend to move closer to the middle so that she wouldn't have to place any of his chips for him because it was so hard for her to do! I guess it was so difficult for her to do because that means she would have to pay attention to what's going on with the game.  After she told my boyfriend to move with such harsh attitude that's when we decided to leave! Worse customer service ever!!!!!!! Who the hell hires these people?! And they wonder why people don't gamble at their casino.   New York, New York please get your sh!t together.  I will never be coming back here for anything.  Worse casino ever.",
positive,"Wow... Just had two amazing sandwiches! Full montagu and caribbean jerk chicken are both delicious sandwiches.  The bread is nice and soft.  Best sandwiches I ever had.   There was a line during lunch time, but it goes pretty quick.  No trouble finding a table either.",
positive,"All you need to know is $2 for an ice cream sandwich!  The staff was friendly, it's easy to get to, and it's clean. There is not a lot of seating but we were lucky and grabbed a bench out front.  I grabbed a double chocolate chip cookie and a chocolate chip cookie with coffee ice cream sandwiched in the middle. The cookies are soft and chewy. It was a perfect afternoon treat :-)",
positive,Mimosas are to die! Fresh squeezed orange juice that they make for every glass. The servers are so knowledgable in the quality of food and even offered to walk us through the gluten free options. Especially Sam! She really seems to love what she does and was on her A game. Will definitely be coming back !,
negative,"From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order. Until recently. I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes. I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak. I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service.",
positive,"I was all excited to go to this place and then read some mixed yelp reviews, and started wondering.   Went around 5:30pm on a Sunday evening, and had 5 minute wait. But by the time I left around 8pm, there was a massive crowd inside and outside waiting. Moral of the story....go early.  I showed the coupon to the hostess just to make sure it would be good, and also handed it first thing to our waiter (just because of some of the random coupon mishap experiences mentioned on yelp).  No problems at all. I'm happy to say this was a great experience. Had joined the eclub and took the email coupon....I'm not sure I would spring for the full price dinner. Service is AMAZING.  Very personable, not overwhelming, extremely professional.  I read some complaints that the cheaper cuts of meat tend to come around more often. Just ask your server or the current person offering meat to your table to send something around. We asked if filet mignon was on the menu for the evening, and less than 5 minutes later the filet mignon guy swung by the table. No annoyance from any of the servers at all.  The \""salad bar\"" is more like salad/antipasto bar.  But I love antipasto so that wasn't a problem for me.  Spicy cauliflower had me hooked, and the other fresh salad greens, veggies, cheeses were great. The potatoes au grautin over at the salad bar were also splendiferous...yeah that's not a word but it is now.  I would actually consider going back for just the salad bar option (though not sure how much that costs). The filet mignon was by far the best, but all the other beef was also extremely tasty. The chicken wrapped in bacon was also good (although how can you go wrong wrapping something in bacon).  I didn't get to warn my partner in time about the yelp reviews regarding the lamb....and those reviews were totally right.  Not our cup of tea.   Yes, the meat is decently salty. Yes, because the salad bar has a lot of antipasto things, it is also salty. But honestly, I was pretty happy with the quality of food.  The exceptions were the lamb and the mashed potatoes brought to the table...the mashed potatoes were indeed toooooooo salty. Did I mention the potatoes au grautin? With the coupon, one glass of wine, one soda, $92.  I kind of figure that if you get a filet mignon dinner from a nice restaurant, it will run you at least $35, and with the wide array of meats available, and the fact you could eat as much as you want, that seemed fair.   If i had another coupon, think I'd go back. Full price...ehhhh...not sure just because of budget. But I think this place is worth a swing through. The food is definitely very decent, and the service makes the experience great.",
positive,"Taco Bell... I favor the #7 and #8. Sometimes with nachos, sometimes with a burrito. However, a #8 with a burrito is like 1375 calories if you choose soda with your included drink. I think it's worth it sometimes... Other times I shudder the thought.",
positive,"Just moved here from vermont looking for great pizza and wings. Well we found it. Pizza is hot crisp tasty. Wings hot, spicy , like i like them to be, staf is friendly and know how to take care of their customers.  They sre quick snd keep your drinks full and bus the table. Nice. Keep up the good work.",
negative,"4 bottles between 5 people...I asked for water and our waitress told me I need to buy it. I need to pay for an $8 water after we dropped so much for 4 bottles at the table? Is Tryst really that money hungry?..I said that's fine, bring us water and I'll pay for it. Water was never brought. In the entire time we were at our table, our waitress came over maybe 4 times. Maybe. We pretty much took care of ourselves while she was busy dancing on stage and in the walkways. Maybe she should apply for a dancer position and tryst should hire legit waitresses....I've been to Vegas several times and this was very poor bottle service.",
negative,"so torn on this review - have to say, have been to the location on Camelback and the one on McDowell and the chicken soup at both locations is amazing. BUT - seriously - the kids quesadilla is just plain gross. It looked and tasted like bottom barrel over processed Velveeta. I am now afraid to try anything else on the menu - if you can't get a simple dish like tortilla and cheese to taste halfway decent, there might be a problem. But have to reiterate - the chicken orzo soup is simply divine!",
